175557073,Farmers caught in the growing competition for carbon,"Throughout last year (2023), the climate change chorus grew louder and shriller, calling for ever more drastic measures to curb the emissions of what are termed greenhouse gasses (GHG), which, in the main, is carbon dioxide, with methane now being roped in as a supporting villain. As of today (January 1), the world’s population stands at around 8.1 billion – a population that is based on carbon chemistry, as is all known life, and requires nutrition in the form of carbon based food. Few people are advocates of an endless population explosion, although Elon Musk has recently repeated his claim that there are still not enough people in the world – this time supported by Jeff Bezos; both are unelected billionaires who would benefit from an expanding customer base. This growth in the number of mouths to feed will require a good deal more food to be produced and, ultimately, that food will require the process of photosynthesis, natures method of fixing the sun’s energy into the solid form we call carbohydrates. Energy rich bonding The basic key of natures energy management strategy is the energy rich bond between carbon and hydrogen. Plants use solar energy to create that bond and then respiration, mostly by animals, breaks it down, releasing the energy once again to fuel the cells of our bodies. In essence, the sun provides the energy to split water to release hydrogen, which is then compounded with carbon to produce food. Oxygen just happens to be a by product of this reaction. Animals take this food and reverse the reaction in a process known as respiration, releasing carbon dioxide and water as they do so, completing several loops, one of which is the carbon cycle. A major factor limiting photosynthesis, is the availability of carbon in the form of CO2, which is why greenhouse growers add it to the air. The same applies to the atmosphere as a whole, the more CO2, the quicker crops will grow, and the more they will yield. What’s more, plants gain greater drought resistance with higher CO2 levels, and NASA satellites have recorded a significant increase in the greening of the planet since they started taking photos in the mid-80s. The bright side of Carbon Yet this positive side to CO2 levels is rarely aired, it is submerged by the doom and gloom of climate change lobbyists, and activists who are part of a multi-trillion dollar industry professing to mitigate global warming. We are therefore left with a growing conflict between the need to feed the world, and the claims of a huge climate change lobby determined to reduce the amount of carbon available to grow the required food. Nowadays, climate activists are fond to pointing to the increase in CO2 levels over the last century or so, jabbing at graphs of the preceding millennia which show CO2 levels dropping to less than 200ppm at times, a threshold below which plant life struggles to survive. Plants need for CO2 is amplified in an international study from 2018 where it was found that levels in excess of 1,100ppm were optimal for the growth of three different grass species, including ryegrass. Farmers dilemma Agriculture is caught right in the middle of this, on the one hand it is being to told to bury more carbon in the ground, while on the other, it faces the demand to feed a growing population. Adding to the organic matter content of soils is always a good idea and is an essential part of increasing and maintaining yields with less inputs, so the sequestration of carbon is only to be encouraged, although it is being found that soils differ in how much carbon they can absorb. Yet, if it is possible to reduce CO2 concentrations by significantly increasing soil organic matter levels, then how much will be left to grow the crops upon? Over the past year, this question has been asked of several machinery companies who are at the sharp end of designing implements to preserve and increase soil carbon levels, while still preparing the ground for crops. There is never a direct answer, nor is there from tractor manufacturers, which happily boast of their green credentials while continuing to supply Tier III engines to markets which don’t insist on expensive exhaust treatments. Carbon as a resource At some point, this competition for carbon will have to be acknowledged by the zealots who are insisting that economies be turned upside down in pursuit of an unrealisable ideal, and that is to halt climate change. There are two other inconvenient truths that will also need to be recognised and discussed more openly, the first being that the climate is always changing, and has been ever since photosynthesis evolved 3.5bn years ago. There are many reasons for this continual development, variation in sun radiation levels and planetary orbits and alignment being the major contenders, yet these are never mentioned in the mad dash to banish oil. There is also the strong suggestion that we are due the next ice, are we really capable of warding it off through what amounts to a miniscule change in the composition of the earths atmosphere? This is due, in the main, to a 70% increase in the demand for energy over the same period, it is now up to 178.9 TWh (Terra Watt hours) which, despite all the talk of peak oil, has been met by the increased use of fossil fuels. A handful of battery powered yard tractors is not going to make the slightest difference to the scale these figures. Farming, and society in general, has been bamboozled into thinking that carbon is bad stuff when in fact quite the opposite is true. We need it to grow our food and the more the merrier. As for it warming the planet, then there are plenty of well-respected scientists who take a far less alarmist view but, when faced with a multi-trillion dollar climate mitigation industry, their voices find it difficult to rise above the clamour.",https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/farmers-caught-in-the-growing-competition-for-carbon/,https://cdn.agriland.ie/uploads/2023/12/DSC_2420-scaled.jpg,2024-01-01 12:00:00,"Jeff Bezos, Justin Roberts","['Jeff Bezos', 'Justin Roberts']",en,ie,0.149
175592149,"Leadership turnover, officer deaths, robbery spike challenged CPD in 2023","For Mayor Brandon Johnson and new leaders of the Chicago Police Department, the dust has started to settle. After a year of sweeping changes and more controversy, the department enters 2024 with a new permanent boss facing a long to-do list: Foster stronger community relationships. Reduce violent crime and shootings. Raise the homicide clearance rate. Maintain officer wellness and morale. And prepare for August, when the city will have an international spotlight as it hosts the 2024 Democratic National Convention. That work will come after a year that saw a mix of highs and lows for the Police Department. Homicide and nonfatal shooting totals fell again, but the city was roiled by robbery and carjacking crews responsible for an overall uptick in violence. Other high-profile crimes gripped the city’s attention at various points during the year, too, like a bizarre August shooting inside Guaranteed Rate Field during a White Sox home game that left two women injured. “Teen takeovers,” the large, unorganized youth gatherings in the downtown area, again left city leaders scratching their heads. Meanwhile, thousands of migrants, mostly from Venezuela, spent months living in and around CPD stations across the city. At the same time, the first class of CPD district councilors — community relations liaisons between police officers and district residents — was sworn in. Larry Snelling meets with the public Sept. 7, 2023, after answering questions at the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood. Snelling, who was the Chicago Police Department's chief of counterterrorism at the time, is now the police superintendent. Johnson’s selection of Larry Snelling to lead CPD came after weeks of public meetings organized by the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability, the new body tasked with submitting CPD superintendent finalists and police board nominees to the mayor. Since he was unanimously approved by the City Council in September, Snelling has repeatedly called for a collaborative and nuanced effort in the city’s crime reduction efforts. In an interview with the Tribune, Snelling said identifying specific problems in each of the CPD’s 22 patrol districts is paramount. “That’s how we get to the bottom of it. We can’t get to the bottom of it with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ strategy, because that strategy is not going to fit within every district,” Snelling said. “So the key is to have a focus on the specific crime that is ailing each particular district or each area. A Far North Side district is not going to have the exact same problems that a Far South Side district. They’ll have some of those problems, but not the clusters, not the amount, not the percentages, so we have to focus on those things as such.” What’s more, the new superintendent has used many of his public appearances to recast attention not on the perpetrators, but the victims of violent crime. Snelling, who grew up in Englewood and first joined the CPD in 1992, also pledged to balance aggressive policing strategies with transparency, even as progress remains slow in the department’s adherence to the federal consent decree that was born out of the 2014 murder of Laquan McDonald. A Tribune analysis of CPD records found that more than 11,000 internal misconduct investigations have been initiated since the consent decree was codified in early 2019. The department hired 698 new officers in 2023, a total that “basically broke even” with the number of retiring officers, Snelling told the Tribune. Though Snelling will likely be the CPD’s only leader in 2024, he was one of four men in 2023 to helm the nation’s second-largest police department. The CPD started the year under David Brown, the former chief of police in Dallas who was handpicked by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot in April 2020. New Chicago police Officer Talisa Ligon, right, hugs her sister, Shaurice Gause, after the Chicago Police Department graduation ceremony in the Aon Grand Ballroom at Navy Pier on Nov. 14, 2023. Brown’s tenure as superintendent was a rocky one, largely defined by civil unrest and looting during the COVID-19 pandemic, a spike in violent crime, and Brown’s unpopularity among rank-and-file cops. Brown announced his resignation a day after Lightfoot failed to qualify for the mayoral runoff election, taking an executive position at a Texas-based law firm. First Deputy Superintendent Eric Carter led the department until May, when Mayor Brandon Johnson selected Fred Waller, the former CPD chief of patrol who retired in August 2020, to serve as interim superintendent until a permanent leader was selected. Both Johnson and Snelling credited Waller for fostering a sense of stability within the department after Brown returned to Texas. But Waller’s time atop the department was not without controversy. In June, the CPD’s head of constitutional policing and reform, Tina Skahill, abruptly resigned from the department after lodging a claim of “retaliation.” Skahill, a veteran CPD supervisor who spent decades within the department, left her post less than a year after Brown fired her predecessor, Robert Boik. Waller, a department fixture who enjoyed great popularity among supervisors and rank and file cops, secured a salary-pension double-dip when Johnson called on him to return to the department. Shortly after he handed the reins to Snelling, Waller was again rehired as the deputy director of Snelling’s office. Snelling, though, has yet to announce any other changes to the CPD’s command staff. The selection of Snelling — who spent much of his career as an instructor in the training academy — was received positively by many within the CPD. Soon after he took over, Snelling did away with a policy that gave officers minimal notice before their regular days off were canceled. In recent weeks, the city has relocated most of the more than 2,000 migrants who spent months living in and around CPD district stations across the city. Ashley Jackson becomes emotional Sept. 23, 2023, during a wake at the New Beginnings Church for her 15-year-old son, Swaysee Rankin, who was shot and killed on Labor Day. A citywide surge in robberies and carjackings, in addition to the steady drumbeat of gun violence that ticks up each summer, left many city residents feeling on edge. According to CPD data, more than 10,800 robberies were reported across the city in 2023, a 23% increase over 2022. The department logged more than 28,000 motor vehicle thefts in 2023, a 38% jump from the year prior. “I want the next generation of shooters to not become shooters, but the generation right now is what we’re all freaked out about and why I worry about my kid riding her bike two blocks from her house,” Rod O’Connor, a resident of Humboldt Park for more than two decades, said during a community safety meeting in September. Meanwhile, the city’s annual homicide tally fell for the third year in a row. Through Dec. 28, Chicago had recorded 648 homicides, still the most of any city in America, but down from 712 homicides in 2022, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. Chicago police use a slightly lower number, eliminating killings deemed non-criminal and those on expressways within the city limits. Through Dec. 30, there were 2,877 people shot across the city in 2023, according to a CPD spokesperson — a decrease of nearly 600 shooting victims from 2022. However, a Tribune analysis in November found the city is in the midst of a sustained uptick in youth homicides. Several more mass shootings were seen, too, including one at a park cookout in Roseland over the Juneteenth holiday weekend and another at a Halloween party in North Lawndale. In late August, the department handled one of the year’s most bizarre incidents. Two women were shot as they sat in the bleachers of Guaranteed Rate Field while the White Sox played the Oakland A’s. No one has been charged in that shooting, and CPD sources have previously suggested that no one will face criminal charges. In late spring and summer, the city’s downtown area once again witnessed a spate of large-scale youth gatherings that sometimes turned violent. Sixteen people were arrested after three teens were shot during an unseasonably warm weekend in April. Another 40 people were arrested during a similar gathering in July. Then CPD Counterterrorism Chief Larry Snelling, who has since become police superintendent, comforts Carmen Cruz, who lost her son, Officer John Cruz, to suicide, during a Fraternal Order of Police ceremony on Sept. 1, 2023, to unveil a Suicide Memorial. Two Chicago police officers were killed in 2023. Andres Vasquez-Lasso was fatally shot in March as he chased an allegedly armed suspect in the Gage Park neighborhood. The suspect was also shot but survived, and his case is still pending. Two months later, Aréanah Preston was shot to death outside her home in Avalon Park shortly after she finished her shift at work. Four teens were charged in her killing. And while Vasquez-Lasso and Preston received traditionally large funeral services, replete with first responders and elected officials, the union that represents CPD officers took steps this year to recognize officers who have died by suicide. In September, the Fraternal Order of Police unveiled a memorial at the entrance of the union’s West Loop lodge to commemorate more than a dozen CPD officers who have died by suicide since 2018. “I think the thing we want most is for our loved ones to be remembered,” Margaret Dougherty, whose husband, Sgt. Edward Dougherty, died by suicide in March 2022, said at the unveiling. “Something like this, just the acknowledgment and the love that they’re showing, it just helps to keep the memory alive.” John Catanzara, president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, arrives before a meeting of the City Council Committee on Workforce Development on ratifying the new police contract on Dec. 7, 2023, at Chicago City Hall. An arbitrator’s ruling during contract negotiations between the city and its largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, produced perhaps the year’s biggest controversy involving the Police Department. In an award made public over the summer, arbitrator Edwin Benn ruled that members of the FOP, a public-sector union, are entitled to having a third party hear and decide the most serious misconduct cases. Those hearings would be off-limits to the public and press. For more than six decades, the nine-member Chicago Police Board was the arbiter in such cases — those in which the CPD superintendent has sought an officer’s firing or, at least, a yearlong suspension. The agreement between the city and union also provided for a nearly 20% raise for officers over four years, on top of a one-time $2,500 bonus. Beyond that, the deal creates a new “Peoples’ Court” where more minor police discipline cases can be decided by an arbitrator in a single day. The deal also paved the way for a new rotation of homicide detectives aimed at improving the department’s homicide clearance rate, which hovered near 50% throughout 2023. The FOP, citing Benn’s award, tried in August to remove 22 pending disciplinary cases from the Police Board’s docket and have them decided instead by a third party. The board shot down the effort. One of those 22 officers, David Laskus, was later ordered fired over his actions during an arrest at the Brickyard Mall in 2020, though court records show Laskus has filed a lawsuit seeking to reverse that decision. The City Council held two votes on the tentative contract agreement: one for the economic package, the lion’s share of the deal, and another to address Benn’s arbitration award. The economic package was approved, but the council voted against the disciplinary provision. John Catanzara, the FOP president, predicted a costly legal fight for the city. “They want war; we’ll give you war,” Catanzara said in an interview with the Tribune following the vote. With its future up in the air, the Police Board saw much turnover in 2023, too. Ghian Foreman’s final term as board president ended, though he’s agreed to continue serving so that the board can reach a voting quorum. The terms of two other board members, the Rev. Michael Eaddy and Mareilé Cusack, also expired, though their replacements have not yet been named. Kyle Cooper, the board’s new president, presided over his first meeting in December. It was then that the board’s vice president, Paula Wolff, announced that four officers would face an evidentiary hearing for misconduct allegations lodged against them in the nearly 20-year-old case of disgraced former CPD Sgt. Ronald Watts, perhaps providing an early test for the reconstituted panel.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-cpd-year-end-20240101-czl3beotkjbtrc42y3y5z2gzgq-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/XnY9x7CsgAH-DjahpjbhpOTivps=/4228x2819/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/NDE666UZRBA3TPWTDHHV7FNCXY.JPG,2024-01-01 12:00:00,Sam Charles,['Sam Charles'],en,us,-0.138
175725585,Big workplace changes are coming in 2024. Are you ready?,"If you thought the pandemic and AI revolution changed work in the past four years, get ready for epic changes coming in 2024. During the past three years, the world of work was turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology saved the economy by enabling millions to work from home using video calls, cloud services, and collaboration software. Then last year, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) changed everything; 2023 was its “breakout year,” according to a survey-based report by McKinsey. The 2023 surge in awareness about large language model (LLM)-based genAI technology resulted from OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and DALL-E tools in 2022. This category of AI has been in development for decades in hundreds of university and corporate labs. But OpenAI was the first to offer the tools to the public (and to developers through application programming interfaces (APIs) as well as to users of Microsoft’s Bing search engine). Easy availability triggered a surge in usage. “ChatGPT” became a mainstream brand. Other organizations scrambled to make their own research publicly usable. Now, in the world of business technology, genAI is everything. It started last spring. By April, a quarter of C-suite executives were using genAI for work and a quarter of boards of directors were talking about using it in the workplace, according to McKinsey, even as both executives and board members remained concerned about the accuracy of AI output. That concern reveals that some view genAI tools as a kind of search engine, confusing the ability of the technology with the quality of the datasets available tools are trained on. In 2024, that confusion will be clarified for many because companies will take a hybrid approach to implementing the fast-evolving technology at work. The big move away from canned data began in November, when OpenAI’s Sam Altman announced GPTs that enable users to create custom versions of ChatGPT for specific purposes. GPTs enable the user’s own data to augment ChatGPT’s training dataset. Over time, tools that enable organizations’ (or industry’s) own data will demonstrate that AI chatbot “hallucinations,” as well as other transgressions, arise because of the data, not the AI technology. Using custom data sets will prove vastly more powerful for true insight and actionable results than generic ones. In any event, the OpenAI chatbot scenario will turn out to be a relatively minor part of the genAI contribution to productivity and knowledge work. In 2024, the technology will be baked into cybersecurity, software development, productivity, customer service, human resources, fleet management and other software and cloud tools. In general, these AI features will help people cope with rising complexity in all things and give them an edge in analysis and pattern spotting. GenAI use will grow vastly more relevant with more specific data inputs and integration into focused applications. The integration of this technology into industry- and occupation-specific solutions will also be accompanied by a cultural backlash against the breathless hype of 2023. Companies that try to replace employees outright with AI will realize that humans empowered with well-designed AI tools are far more effective than AI working on its own. As with all new technologies, once the hype dies down and the tech becomes a ubiquitous banality, we’ll know it’s become truly powerful, useful ,and transformative. In general, AI will become universal and normal, even as it boosts economic output much as the PC, networking, and web revolutions did in the 1990s. Get ready for a new set of realities We’ve been talking about augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) for many years. But 2024 is the year high-resolution, high-quality AR goes mainstream (and by “mainstream,” I mean that Apple will launch its AR product, the Apple Vision Pro). No, the Vision Pro itself won’t become a mass-market product like the iPhone anytime soon, or ever. Because of the difficulty in sourcing and manufacturing, as well as the high purchase price, large size and limited battery life, unit sales will be lower than other Apple products. Estimates range from 200,000 to 500,000 units in the first year. Canalys estimates unit sales to exceed 10 million per year within four years. By comparison Apple sells well over 200 million iPhones every year. Analysts expect lower-cost Vision Pro versions, as well as smaller and lighter headsets, in the years to come to drive higher sales. (And it will affect the larger AR/VR industry.) It’s also worth noting that Vision Pro technologies will spill over into other Apple Products, dragooning the entire Apple ecosystem into its orbit. For example, MacBook Pro users will be doing FaceTime calls with Vision Pro users. The laptop users will have their faces 3D scanned, and they’ll see the 3D scanned avatar of the Vision Pro user as a participant in the meeting. Users of Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max smartphones will be able to use those devices to capture 3D “spacial” videos viewable on Vision Pro devices. These are two early ways that non-Vision Pro users can participate in Vision Pro technologies, and there will surely be others coming in the future. As with Apple’s previous entries into the music player, smartphone, tablet and smart watch markets, the Vision Pro will put buyers, competitors, and developers on notice, focusing the industry on the new category. By the end of 2024, AR will be ubiquitous and inescapable. Dozens of major companies will offer Vision Pro-like AR/VR solutions optimized for the workplace at a wide range of prices. In this case, enterprise-specific AR solutions will lead the way, with consumer devices lagging. Another category of AR will hit companies in unexpected ways; I call it non-holographic AR, and the leader in this industry will be Meta, which is already testing something it calls multimodal AI. Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which shipped Oct. 17, have a camera, which can be used for taking pictures and videos and live-streaming to Instagram or Facebook. With a software update (available first to early adopters in December), users will be able to use the camera to recognize objects and get AI-driven information and even advice (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the feature by asking what pants might go well with a shirt he was holding.) The use of internet-connected glasses with cameras (by Meta and its many coming competitors) to augment reality (with the output coming in the form of spoken words from AI rather than holographic visual objects) are going to affect business, as a growing percentage of employees in all departments will be wearing them all day, every day. The impact will be akin to the smartphone revolution, where the power of computers, apps, the internet and digital communication will be made much more accessible and quickly available through glasses than via a smartphone. The combination of Apple its mainstreaming high-resolution holographic AR and Meta mainstreaming its non-holographic AR means the workplace will be transformed by AR starting in 2024. Flex work will be the new normal The pandemic forced businesses to allow remote work at scale for the first time ever. Many employees got used to it, and now prefer working from home. But a large number of businesses continues to resist the trend, imposing back-to-office mandates. While the work-from-home (WFH) standoff has become the conventional wisdom, it’s also a misleading oversimplification. In fact, many organizations are thriving with remote and hybrid work policies. And many employees love coming to the office. A recent study by FORA found that the youngest workers, aged 18 to 24, are the most enthusiastic bracket for wanting to work in offices; this group also responds best to in-office perks like cafes, gyms, and rules allowing pets at work. Large companies that impose back-to-office mandates on employees who don’t want to commute or work in an office face pushback in the form of petitions, resignations, and difficulty in hiring. Even the most strident back-to-office companies are explicitly hiring for remote positions in job areas of highest demand, knowing that the only way to hire the best workers is to offer a WFH option. Some workplace specialists say companies are even using back-to-office mandates as a way to lay off employees without laying them off, knowing large numbers will quit in response to the mandates (or can be fired for cause if they refuse to return). Still, the reality is that for many companies, allowing remote work is essential for meeting inclusivity targets and coping with talent shortages. What’s lost on many organizations is that the “mandate” part of back-to-office mandates is the most objectionable part. Working from home enables workers to tailor their work schedule in a way that enables them to cope with the many other “mandates” in their lives. As a simple example, a family with two spouses and two children can be a scheduling nightmare. If both adults are “mandated” to be in the office until 5pm, and the school “mandates” that one of the children be picked up at 3pm, the problem is obvious. In reality, modern family life is far more complicated than that, and no workplace can schedule work time better than the employee. So, whether employees are working in the office, at home, or a mix of both, flex work will be the new normal in 2024. “Flex work” is less about where one works and more about when. Allowing employees to work when they choose — and providing the asynchronous communication tools to enable that — will be essential to hiring and retaining employees in 2024. Forcing employees to work in an office during set hours diminishes mental and physical health, wastes time, costs more, increases distraction, reduces productivity, degrades morale and damages work-life balance. Companies that fail to offer flex work and remote work will have a harder time competing in the marketplace because their workforce will tend to be understaffed, overworked and over-stressed. By contrast, companies that offer flex and remote work options will have a competitive advantage. A Darwinian process will favor those who cultivate the cultures and management styles that make flex work succeed. The dinosaurs will die out. The bottom line is that changes are surely coming to how, when, and where we work. The time to prepare for the new technology-enabled workplace — the new world of AI, AR and flex work — is now.",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3711762/big-workplace-changes-are-coming-in-2024-are-you-ready.html,https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2023/07/14/10/high_speed_train_tunnel_motion_blue_long_exposure_speed_motion_forward_progress_future_whats_next_by_mlenny_gettyimages-1195455865_2400x1600-100877732-large-100943403-large.jpg?auto=web,2024-01-01 12:00:00,,[],en,us,0.092
175559319,Animals Believed to Be Extinct Were Found All Over the World This Year,"The past year brought a glimmer of positive conservation news as several animal species thought to be extinct were rediscovered.Species have gone extinct at a much higher rate than is expected with evolution, and the blame has largely been placed on humans and their detrimental impact on certain species' environments. Experts believe that the modern extinction rate is as much as 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate, according to the World Wildlife Fund. But rediscovering a species previously thought to be extinct provides a spark of hope.The animals found across the globe included such species as reptiles, fish and mammals.In October, an extinct colony of little penguins was reestablished after 30 years when a chick hatched for the first time since 1993. A breeding pair finally returned to the Eagles Claw Nature Reserve, located in Eden, Australia. Researchers thought that predators such as foxes had hunted the species to extinction.Typically, a species is declared extinct if it hasn't been sighted for more than 50 years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) followed the guidelines for decades, but the organization refined them in the 1990s so that a species can be listed as extinct if there is ""no reasonable doubt that the last individual member has died,"" according to Discover magazine.Newsweek reached out to the IUCN by email for comment.Another species also was found to be living in Australia this year after it was previously thought to have permanently vanished: a rare lizard called the Lyon's grassland striped skink.The skink hadn't been seen for 42 years, and researchers feared it was extinct. However, the skink reappeared in April in northeastern Queensland after researchers embarked on a mission to identify highly threatened reptiles in the area.A scent detection dog was used in South Africa to find the De Winton's golden mole, an elusive mammal that lives almost entirely underground and doesn't leave behind tunnels as other species of moles do.""Though many people doubted that De Winton's golden mole was still out there, I had good faith that the species had not yet gone extinct,"" Cobus Theron, a senior conservation manager at Endangered Wildlife Trust and a member of the search team, said in a press release. ""I was convinced it would just take the right detection method, the proper timing and a team passionate about finding it.""He continued: ""I think it's just fantastic that in 2023 we can still rediscover species. All of our stories around conservation are doom and gloom. Here we have an opportunity to say that actually there are opportunities to make change.""Most of the animals thought to be extinct were difficult to find. For example, Attenborough's long-beaked echidna—named after British naturalist, writer and historian David Attenborough—was discovered in New Guinea solely through sightings on trail cameras. Before the video sightings in November, the echidna hadn't been seen for 60 years.Once rediscovered, some animals still face the threat of endangerment, but that wasn't the case for a species of fish in the North Sea. Scientists discovered an abundance of houting, a whitefish species, thriving throughout the sea after it was officially declared extinct in 2008.The fish wasn't evasive or endangered—but its DNA was so genetically similar to the European whitefish that they were considered the same species.Despite the rediscovery news, extinction is still a massive threat to thousands of species. The IUCN lists more than 40,000 species as threatened, with more than 9,000 species considered critically endangered.",https://www.newsweek.com/animals-believed-extinct-were-found-all-over-world-this-year-1855785,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2328624/animals-thought-extinct-rediscovered-2023.png,2024-01-01 12:00:01,Anna Skinner,['Anna Skinner'],en,us,-0.088
175585505,Kilkenny photograph is overall junior winner in forest photo competition,"The overall winners of the 2023 Teagasc forest photo competition have been announced by the Minister of State for Land Use and Biodiversity, Senator Pippa Hackett. This year’s competition, “Celebrating the New Forestry Programme 2023 – 2027”, had three themes and, for the first time, both an adult and junior age category. Each theme winner was chosen by a panel of judges and the final selection of the overall winners in each age category was by popular choice. Voting was brisk all weekend and today the winners were finally clear. The overall winner in the adult category is Adrian Nolan from County Galway. Adrian’s striking photo is very well composed and reminds us that fungi play an essential role in the forest cycle, and as part of its biodiversity, and are often overlooked. In the junior category the deserving winner is Jake Byrne from Kilkenny. Jake’s image (below) was simple, yet really impactful. It captured the sense of fun that can be had from a few pieces of timber combined with a good sprinkling of imagination. Each of the winners will receive a voucher for €300 to add to their earlier voucher of the same amount bringing their total winnings to €600. Congratulating, the competition winners, Minister Hackett said: “I am delighted to announce Adrian and Jake as the overall and well-deserved winners. I would like to thank all the entrants for showcasing such wonderful examples of the many roles forests play in all our lives”. Minister Hackett continued; “I would also like to thank Teagasc for their important work in promoting and celebrating the variety of themes contained within the new Forestry Programme 2023-2027. This programme is the most ambitious to date and supports landowners to plant trees in a manner that provides lasting climate, biodiversity, wood production, employment, and wider societal benefits. Forests have an important and lasting influence across generations, and I welcome that this competition reflects this, with two new distinct age categories.” Teagasc Forestry Liaison Officer Paul Butler, who co-ordinated the initiative said: “Teagasc sincerely thanks all participants who submitted high quality photographs to our 2023 competition. It really is a pleasure see the varied ways the ecosystems, products and services of our forests are reflected in the images presented. I would also like to thank the judging panel who had such a challenging task in selecting the winners in each theme and also the Teagasc Public Relations Department for their invaluable help in promoting the competition. We look forward to organising another photo competition in 2024”. The winning photos from the Teagasc forest photo competition will shortly be available to view on the Teagasc website at www.teagasc.ie/forestphotos . This competition was coordinated by Teagasc with support from the Forestry Division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM).",https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/farming-news/1382701/kilkenny-photograph-is-overall-junior-winner-in-forest-photo-competition.html,https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/resizer/-1/-1/true/2023_12_29/Overall_winners_of_Teagasc_Forest_Photo_Competition_2023_%281%29-1703853690735.jpg--.jpg?1703853692040,2024-01-01 12:00:01,Sian Moloughney,['Sian Moloughney'],en,ie,0.771
175564529,We Absolutely Do Not Need an FDA for AI,"I don't know whether artificial intelligence (AI) will give us a 4-hour workweek, write all of our code and emails, and drive our cars—or whether it will destroy our economy and our grasp on reality, fire our nukes, and then turn us all into gray goo. Possibly all of the above. But I'm supremely confident about one thing: No one else knows either. November saw the public airing of some very dirty laundry at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence research organization that brought us ChatGPT, when the board abruptly announced the dismissal of CEO Sam Altman. What followed was a nerd game of thrones (assuming robots are nerdier than dragons, a debatable proposition) that consisted of a quick parade of three CEOs and ended with Altman back in charge. The shenanigans highlighted the many axes on which even the best-informed, most plugged-in AI experts disagree. Is AI a big deal, or the biggest deal? Do we owe it to future generations to pump the brakes or to smash the accelerator? Can the general public be trusted with this tech? And—the question that seems to have powered more of the recent upheaval than anything else—who the hell is in charge here? OpenAI had a somewhat novel corporate structure, in which a nonprofit board tasked with keeping the best interests of humanity in mind sat on top of a for-profit entity with Microsoft as a significant investor. This is what happens when effective altruism and ESG do shrooms together while rolling around in a few billion dollars. After the events of November, this particular setup doesn't seem to have been the right approach. Altman and his new board say they're working on the next iteration of governance alongside the next iteration of their AI chatbot. Meanwhile, OpenAI has numerous competitors—including Google's Bard, Meta's Llama, Anthropic's Claude, and something Elon Musk built in his basement called Grok—several of which differentiate themselves by emphasizing different combinations of safety, profitability, and speed. Labels for the factions proliferate. The e/acc crowd wants to ""build the machine god."" Techno-optimist Marc Andreessen declared in a manifesto that ""we believe intelligence is in an upward spiral—first, as more smart people around the world are recruited into the techno-capital machine; second, as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems such as companies and networks; third, as Artificial Intelligence ramps up the capabilities of our machines and ourselves."" Meanwhile Snoop Dogg is channeling AI pioneer-turned-doomer Geoffrey Hinton when he said on a recent podcast: ""Then I heard the old dude that created AI saying, 'This is not safe 'cause the AIs got their own mind and these motherfuckers gonna start doing their own shit.' And I'm like, 'Is we in a fucking movie right now or what?'"" (Hinton told Wired, ""Snoop gets it."") And the safetyists just keep shouting the word guardrails. (Emmett Shear, who was briefly tapped for the OpenAI CEO spot, helpfully tweeted this faction compass for the uninitiated.) wake up babe, AI faction compass just became more relevant pic.twitter.com/MwYOLedYxV — Emmett Shear (@eshear) November 18, 2023 If even our best and brightest technologists and theorists are struggling to see the way forward for AI, what makes anyone think that the power elite in Washington, D.C., and state capitals are going to get there first? When the release of ChatGPT 3.5 about a year ago triggered an arms race, politicians and regulators collectively swiveled their heads toward AI like a pack of prairie dogs. State legislators introduced 191 AI​-related bills this year, according to a September report from the software industry group BSA. That's a 440 percent increase from the number of AI-related bills introduced in 2022. In a May hearing of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, at which Altman testified, senators and witnesses cited the Food and Drug Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as models for a new AI agency, with Altman declaring the latter ""a great analogy"" for what is needed. Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D–Conn.) and Josh Hawley (R–Mo.) released a regulatory framework that includes a new AI regulatory agency, licensing requirements, increased liability for developers, and many more mandates. A bill from Sens. John Thune (R–S.D.) and Amy Klobuchar (D–Minn.) is softer and more bipartisan, but would still represent a huge new regulatory effort. And President Joe Biden announced a sweeping executive order on AI in October. But ""America did not have a Federal Internet Agency or National Software Bureau for the digital revolution,"" as Adam Thierer has written for the R Street Institute, ""and it does not need a Department of AI now."" Aside from the usual risk throttling of innovation, there is the concern about regulatory capture. The industry has a handful of major players with billions invested and a huge head start, who would benefit from regulations written with their input. Though he has rightly voiced worries about ""what happens to countries that try to overregulate tech,"" Altman has also called concerns about regulatory capture a ""transparently, intellectually dishonest response."" More importantly, he has said: ""No one person should be trusted here….If this really works, it's quite a powerful technology, and you should not trust one company and certainly not one person."" Nor should we trust our politicians. One silver lining: While legislators try to figure out their priorities on AI, other tech regulation has fallen by the wayside. Regulations on privacy, self-driving cars, and social media have been buried by the wave of new bills and interest in the sexy new tech menace. One thing is clear: We are not in a Jurassic Park situation. If anything, we are experiencing the opposite of Jeff Goldblum's famous line about scientists who ""were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" The most prominent people in AI seem to spend most of their time asking if they should. It's a good question. There's just no reason to think politicians or bureaucrats will do a good job answering it.",https://reason.com/2024/01/01/we-absolutely-do-not-need-an-fda-for-ai/,https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2023/12/topicsfuture.jpg,2024-01-01 12:00:16,Katherine Mangu-Ward,['Katherine Mangu-Ward'],en,us,0.035
175563363,"Rock trio HotWax: ‘After Covid, bands are like: we’ll just do what we want’","From West SussexRecommended if you like Hole, the White Stripes, the BreedersUp next Debut album and a UK tour The members of the rock trio HotWax attest that their 2023 has been “crazy”. At the start of the year, they had never even been on tour. When I speak to them, they have just returned from a month playing around the US. “It blew our minds,” enthuses the vocalist and guitarist Tallulah Sim-Savage. “Even though the drives were really long, it was like watching a 12-hour film of some interesting scenery.” They spent the summer playing festivals. They went to Italy at the behest of One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson for his Away from Home festival, played Reading and Leeds and – most surreally of all for HotWax – supported Yeah Yeah Yeahs at All Points East. “My favourite band,” nods Sim-Savage. “My dream band to support, so I was terrified, but I really just let go and enjoyed the experience.” The feeling appeared to be mutual: when Yeah Yeah Yeah played Maps, Karen O dedicated it to them. They have released two acclaimed EPs and been heralded as part of a new wave of incendiary guitar bands, including Spiritual Cramp, Lambrini Girls and Duvet. If you are looking for a vague pointer towards their raging sound, Sim-Savage has previously credited the sound of her mum playing Hole’s Live Through This as “the thing that changed everything”. Things seem to be moving very fast, but as the bassist Lola Sam points out, it has been a long time coming. She and Sim-Savage have been in bands together since they were 13; they started HotWax two years later, in 2019. They gigged around their native Hastings, performing largely improvised and instrumental sets of what Sam calls “wishy-washy psychedelia” (the kind of music, Sim-Savage suggests, that you might make if “you’re 15 and in Covid and smoking loads of weed”), before their style took a turn. “Everything is more organised now,” says Sam. “It’s more structured. It became more heavy and more poppy at the same time.” They found their drummer, Alfie Sayer, while studying at the music college Bimm in Brighton. His recruitment aside, their tenure there doesn’t sound like it was a roaring success: Sam lasted a term (“it was very much, like, jazz boys who wanted to play like that”). They dropped out, self-released singles and played “wherever would have us”, but by Sim-Savage’s reckoning they “didn’t really know what we were doing” until they met their manager, whose suggestion that they could “actually try and do this properly” so startled the band that Sim-Savage initially turned her down. “We never did this to do really well or whatever,” she frowns. “It’s just something we really, really enjoyed doing.” And yet they are clearly doing really well, offering a fierce counterargument to the long-held wisdom that noisy guitar rock has had its day. “I think it’s got something to do with Covid,” says Sam. “Bands were on the rise, then had to stop deciding to really go for it. People were stuck in for so long. Now, they’re like: no, we’ll just do what we want to do when we have the chance.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/01/rock-trio-hotwax-after-covid-bands-are-like-well-just-do-what-we-want,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92f54f8efe91663909af59d150eb640c640ccf7/0_99_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm,2024-01-01 12:00:29,Alexis Petridis,['Alexis Petridis'],en,us,0.155
175557159,What’s next for tech in 2024?,"Have you ever wondered what the future will look like? Well, you don’t have to wait too long, because 2024 is going to be a year full of amazing innovations that will blow your mind. Here are seven emerging trends and innovations in tech that will no doubt transform our lives over the next year. CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER 1) Artificial Intelligence continues to revolutionize our lives AI is everywhere, from our daily gadgets like smartphones and smart speakers, to our smart homes that can adjust the temperature, lighting, and security according to our preferences. But AI is not just making our lives more convenient and comfortable, it’s also set to revolutionize healthcare and other industries with some groundbreaking innovations. Neuralink's revolutionary wireless device One of the most anticipated and ambitious projects in this field of AI is Neuralink, a brain-computer interface company founded by Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX. Neuralink aims to create a wireless device that can be implanted in the brain and connect it to a computer or a smartphone, allowing users to control devices, access information, and communicate with others just by thinking. Imagine controlling prosthetic limbs or enhancing cognitive abilities just by thinking. MORE: TOP 10 WEIRDEST TECH INNOVATIONS OF 2023 Keep an eye on Kernel Neuralink is not the only company working on brain-computer interfaces. Other ones to keep an eye on are Kernel, a neurotech company, which is creating a ""mind-reading"" helmet that uses sensors and lasers to gain information about the brain’s activity, blood oxygen levels, and more. By collecting detailed data on how the brain works and behaves, the hope is it could lead to new insights and breakthroughs in mental health, aging, cognition, and other aspects of brain health. THE VERY WORST AND WEAKEST PASSWORDS OF 2023 Meta bets on AI and the Metaverse Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, is leading the way with its two long-term bets on the future: AI and the metaverse. These two technologies are not only advancing rapidly, but also converging to create new possibilities for human interaction and creativity. AI is becoming more accessible and powerful than ever, thanks to Meta’s open-source models like Llama and Llama 2, which have been adopted and improved by millions of developers around the world. AI is also becoming more integrated into the products we use every day, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, where you can generate images, chat with assistants, write better, and edit photos with ease. The metaverse is also taking shape, with Meta’s Reality Labs developing new devices and platforms that enable immersive and social experiences in virtual and augmented reality. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses were the first step towards a future where AI can see the world from our perspective and help us navigate it. The Meta AI assistant is a new kind of companion that will be launched in 2024. It can understand and respond to your voice, vision, and gestures. Since Meta is trying to play catch-up with ChatGPT, it hired a couple dozen big-name celebrities to be the look and voice of Meta’s new AI voice assistant. The celebs will embody the AI and play them. 2) Augmented reality is taking us to new dimensions Augmented reality, or AR, is the technology that overlays digital information and images on the real world, creating a mixed reality experience. AR is taking us to new dimensions, as companies like Apple, Meta, Snapchat, and Niantic are creating immersive and engaging experiences that enhance our perception and interaction with the world. But don't think AR is just for gaming and entertainment, it’s also for education and learning. AR can make learning more fun and interactive, as it can bring subjects and concepts to life. Augmented reality is bringing shopping to you Another domain where AR is making a big impact is shopping. AR can help you make better and more informed decisions, as it can let you try on products, see how they look or fit, and compare different options. Amazon and Walmart are already leveraging AR to provide immersive shopping experiences with its virtual try-on feature. AR is reshaping our world, and we can expect to see more innovation and adoption in 2024 and beyond. 3) Expect advances in bioprinting artificial tissue and organs Another exciting innovation in healthcare is bioprinting, which is the use of 3D printing to create artificial tissue and organs. Bioprinting could potentially solve the problem of organ shortage and transplant rejection, as well as enable personalized medicine and drug testing. Bioprinting is still in its early stages, but some companies and researchers like those at MIT have already made some impressive progress. AI is truly changing medicine as we know it, and we can expect to see more breakthroughs and applications in 2024 and beyond. 4) Autonomous electric taxi service becomes available One of the most anticipated technologies in 2024 is the autonomous electric taxi service by Zoox, a subsidiary of Amazon. Their tag line is, ""Built for riders - not for drivers."" Zoox has been developing and testing its self-driving vehicles in various cities since 2020, and plans to launch its service in 2024. Zoox’s vehicles are designed to navigate complex urban environments with four-wheel steering, bidirectional driving, and a spacious cabin that can fit four passengers. Zoox’s taxis can be booked through an app or a kiosk, and offer a flat rate per mile. Zoox aims to provide a safer, more efficient, and more comfortable alternative to conventional taxis, and to reduce traffic and pollution. 5) More drone delivery services in the sky The year 2024 is expected to witness significant growth in the use of drone delivery services, especially in urban areas where traffic congestion and pollution are major challenges. Drone delivery services offer a fast, convenient, and eco-friendly way of transporting goods and services to customers, reducing the need for road vehicles and human labor. One of the leading companies in this field is Amazon, which added a third U.S. city that will soon have the option to get their packages delivered by a drone beginning in late 2024. The company's Prime Air has been using drones to safely deliver packages weighing up to five pounds in one hour or less, for almost a year. Prime Air is also unveiling the new MK30 drone design, which the company claims is quieter, smaller, and lighter than previous models.

More and more of these houses are going to be going up in 2024 as a cost-effective and eco-friendly way of constructing houses. A company called ICON is a leader in 3D printing technology for construction, with a mission to revolutionize the way we build and live. They have developed a robotic system that can print an entire house layer by layer, using a durable material called Lavacrete, which is a type of concrete that can withstand extreme weather conditions and natural disasters while also reducing waste and emissions. ICON has already printed several houses around the world, including the first 3D-printed community in Austin, Texas. ICON’s vision is to make 3D printing accessible to everyone and to create homes that are beautiful, functional, and resilient.

According to some experts, electric vehicles (EVs) will account for more than 40% of new car sales in the US by 2024, thanks to the increasing affordability, performance, and environmental benefits of EVs. Whether you’re looking for a budget-friendly Kia Niro, an all-American Ford F-150 Lightning, a futuristic Tesla Cybertruck, a lavish Rolls-Royce Spectre, or a sleek Hyundai IONIQ 6, there’s an EV for everyone. Car sharing is also expected to grow significantly in 2024, as more people opt for convenient and cost-effective transportation solutions. Some of the leading car-sharing platforms, such as Zipcar, Turo, and Getaround, will offer more options for EV rentals, as well as innovative features such as peer-to-peer sharing, autonomous driving, and smart charging. With electric cars and car sharing, the future of transportation looks bright and green in 2024. Kurt's key takeaways As we look ahead to 2024 and beyond, it's clear that the world of technology is poised for exciting transformations. Artificial Intelligence, augmented reality, bioprinting, autonomous electric taxis, drone delivery services, 3D printed houses, and electric cars are all shaping a future that promises greater convenience, sustainability, and innovation. These advancements are not just changing industries; they're revolutionizing the way we live, work, and interact with the world.

175562243,Inverness revellers ring in 2024 with &#8216;World&#8217;s Largest Ceilidh&#8217;,"A huge party in Inverness saw crowds enjoy the “World’s Largest Ceilidh” to ring in 2024, at the Northern Meeting Park. From first-time first footers to impromptu singing the event was deemed a success for organisers, and for the 5,000 people who attended the four-hour-long party. A procession was led through the streets of the city to herald the start of the event at 8.30pm. Headlining were Highland Fire – including singer Calum MacPhail and Sea Cousins from Horo. Norrie MacIver, who sings as a solo artist and with Celtic supergroup Skipinnish, sang in both Gaelic and English to the crowd. BBC Radio 2 Folk Award winner Siobhan Miller brought in the bells with the crowd. Seven minutes of fireworks at Inverness’ ‘World’s Largest Ceilidh’ Ross Ainslie and Ali Hutton provided the backdrop to an incredible seven-minute-long firework display. The crowd even held their own in an impromptu singing of Dolly Parton’s classic “Country Roads”. Ceilidh dancing was also high on the agenda, with revellers enjoying a Strip the Willow and a Dashing White Sergeant as well as many other dances during the night. Among the attendees was Kirstie Kearns, enjoying her first Hogmanay in the Highlands. Originally from Inverness, the 48-year-old nurse grew up on the other side of the world in Australia. Joined by three generations of her family, she welcomed the start of a New Year as part of her festive holidays. Speaking to The P&J, Kirstie, who lives in Darwin, Australia, said she loved the atmosphere, despite the chill in the air. She said: “We are over on holiday with three generations of our family. “I was born here but grew up in Australia, so we come here every five years. “I’ve never been up here for Hogmanay. “I didn’t realise it would be quite this cold, but I love it. It is a great atmosphere.” Kirstie says her hope for 2024 is to “have fun.” Matt Procter was also enjoying his first Hogmanay in the Highland capital surrounded by family. The 40-year-old moved from Essex to Drumnadrochit in March, with his wife and children, to begin a new life in the Highlands. ‘It is amazing’ Matt said the event helped them to celebrate the momentous occasion in style. He said: “It is our first Hogmanay festival, so we thought we would come along and have a look. “We said, what should we do to make it special as it is our first one so we thought why not come and see this, see what it is all about, have a boogie and learn to ceilidh dance. It is amazing.” He said their aim for 2024 is to see more of the Scottish Highlands; their new backyard. Joining Matt was his brother-in-law Aron Rayner, who also relocated with his family to Drumnadrochit. Aron, 39, said they had already begun planning their return next year. He said: “We are actually putting together a list already of who we want to bring up next year for it. We are trying to work out which family members would be able to stick it or not.” The event was also a family affair for Chris Andrew from Ardersier. The 39-year-old, who works as a tarmac layer, danced the night away as he relished in Scotland’s Hogmanay traditions. He said: “It is all about spending time with the family. “The kids are a bit older now so we try to keep them out, let them enjoy the Scottish traditional music and everything it is about; being part of the Highlands. “It is all about making memories. My boy plays the pipes and he keeps saying, ‘That’s what I want to be’, all the time. ‘It has been brilliant’ “It is so good; you’ve got people of so many different ages. It has been brilliant.” Chris joked that his New Year resolution was to drink less and listen to more Scottish music. Fiona Dolan travelled from Alness with her granddaughters to enjoy the evening’s festivities. The 56-year-old church coordinator said: “I turned out because I have two 10-year-old grandaughters. It is great to come as a family. “We were here last year, but I think for the kids the ceilidh is good. Rather than listening, they can get up and dance. “I’m not a tourist, but I also think for tourists, it is quite fun. It gives it a bit of character. A spokesman for the organisers said: “We are delighted with the nearly four thousand guests that joined us to celebrate the bells for what was a new twist on a traditional Inverness Event. “The parade, a new addition to this year’s line up set the tone for what became a memorable night with fire performers, drummers and pipe bands involved. “Revellers were entertained by the highest quality performances from Scotland’s leading traditional music artists and we were amazed at the engagement shown by the audience in joining in the dancing and singing along throughout the evening. “We would like to thank all those who joined us to celebrate Hogmanay, with a special thanks to the public who created a fantastic atmosphere. “We’re looking forward to developing the event for the future and to continue to improve what we can offer in our Events programme supported by the City of Inverness Councillors and the Inverness Common Good Fund.”",https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/inverness/6313332/inverness-2024-worlds-largest-ceilidh/,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Kirstie-Right-behind-pink-hat-pictured-with-her-family-2apnj9p9w-e1704104609490.jpg,2024-01-01 12:03:54,Louise Glen,['Louise Glen'],en,gb,0.785
175586563,Enkuuka Festival: Celebrating Culture Amidst Challenges and Artist Safety Concerns,"The Enkuuka festival, this year was dubbed ‘Enkuuka Tobongoota’ an annual celebration deeply rooted in Ugandan culture organized in the Buganda Kingdom’s place Mengo Enkuuka festival has long been a cornerstone of communal joy, artistic expression, and cultural heritage where artists across the country are given a chance to perform. Dating back to ancient times, this vibrant event has thrived in its ability to unite people through music, dance, and storytelling and people especially Baganda get to learn more about their folks and norms this is through the grand finale of ‘Entanda ya Buganda’ where the winner goes with a plot of land. However, amidst its successes, the festival has faced its share of challenges, particularly in protecting artists from instances of violent humiliation at the hands of the audience. The festival’s triumphs are evident in its ability to preserve traditional Ugandan arts and provide a platform for local talents to showcase their skills. Enkuuka has been instrumental in promoting cultural understanding and fostering a sense of pride among Ugandans, both locally and within the diaspora. Its colourful displays of music and dance serve as a testament to the richness of Uganda’s diverse heritage, drawing crowds from far and wide to partake in this cultural extravaganza. Yet, within this celebration of culture, some unfortunate incidents have marred the festival’s reputation. Shockingly, a few artists have faced violence and humiliation from sections of the audience. In the most recent iteration of the festival, artists like Sheebah Karungi faced significant challenges during their performances, impacting the celebratory transition into the new year for music enthusiasts. Sheebah shared her experience of anticipation, eagerly awaiting her turn to grace the stage. However, as soon as she commenced her performance, technical issues disrupted the sound system, coinciding with disturbances escalating into fights on stage. Despite her efforts to engage the crowd without adequate sound support, the situation became untenable, leading her to eventually leave the stage. Ray G, one of Western Uganda’s esteemed singers, encountered the same distressing situation where his performance was marred by a disturbing incident. As he stepped onto the stage to commence his act, he faced a barrage of objects thrown in his direction, preventing him from completing his performance peacefully. Other artists, like Omukunja Atasera and his partner King Sheebah, also fell victim to the aggression of disgruntled attendees during the same event. They faced a distressing situation as bottles were thrown at them, disrupting their performances and endangering their safety amidst the hostility of the crowd. Despite efforts to create a safe and respectful environment, instances of disrespect and mistreatment toward performers have surfaced, causing distress and raising concerns about the festival’s ability to safeguard its participants. The incidents, often sparked by disagreements or misunderstandings, have underscored the need for improved security measures and increased awareness among attendees about respecting the performers. Ensuring the safety and dignity of artists must be a priority for the festival’s organizers to maintain Enkuuka’s essence as a celebration of cultural expression and unity. Efforts to address these issues include enhanced security protocols, educational initiatives aimed at fostering mutual respect among festival-goers, and collaborative dialogues involving artists, organizers, and the community. These steps are crucial in creating a supportive and secure environment where artists can freely express themselves without fear of mistreatment or humiliation. The Enkuuka festival stands at a crossroads, balancing its achievements in promoting culture with the imperative to address and rectify the incidents tarnishing its reputation. While its successes are evident in its cultural significance and ability to bring people together, the festival must confront its failures in safeguarding artists against violence and humiliation. As the festival evolves, its commitment to cultural celebration and the well-being of its participants must go hand in hand.

175554459,"New year, new job! As Crown Princess Mary of Denmark steps up to become Queen following Margrethe's...","Crown Princess Mary is preparing for her role as Queen, after her mother-in-law shocked the nation when she announced her abdication from the throne in a speech on New Year's Eve. But how the life of the royal - who is originally from Australia - will change is still yet unknown. While the 51-year-old is beloved in the country, and in October 2019 was named regent - which gave her the power perform duties as head of state when Margrethe II was overseas or otherwise engaged - fans will now be excited to see what Mary does with her new role. Yesterday, Queen Margrethe revealed that she would be stepping down as monarch after 52 years. She will be succeeded by her son, Crown Prince Frederik, on January 14. Crown Princess Mary is preparing for her role as Queen, after her mother-in-law shocked the nation when she announced her abdication from the throne in a speech on New Year's Eve. Mary and her husband pictured in November It means his wife Mary, whom he first met at a pub in Sydney, will soon become the world's first Australian-born queen. She was working as an advertising executive when she first met Frederik in a packed city pub 23 years ago and had no idea the handsome European tourist she had been chatting to for hours was actually the future king of Denmark. Now, married for 19 years and proud parents to four children, Mary has won her adopted country over by her dedication to royal duty and her fluency in the language. And despite speculation about the state of the royal couple's marriage over the years, there is nothing concrete to suggest they are anything but happily married. The pair was most recently rocked by rumours after photographs emerged of Frederik, 55, enjoying a night out with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova in Madrid in October. But despite allegations of an 'affair', Frederik and Mary made a show of unity as they headed into Aarhus cathedral on Christmas Eve. Here, FEMAIL looks at what may change - and what may stay the same - in Mary's life as she moves forward into her new role... GUIDANCE FROM HER MOTHER-IN-LAW According to one source from 2021, stepping down has been on Margrethe's mind for quite some time now. Speaking to Woman's Day, the insider explained that the royal had been slowly but surely guiding her daughter-in-law for the duties over the years. Yesterday, Queen Margrethe revealed that she would be stepping down as monarch after 52 years. Pictured with Mary in February 2022 The Danish Queen (right) will be succeeded by her eldest son Crown Prince Frederik (centre) pictured with his Australian-born wife Crown Princess Mary in 2018 'If Margrethe's plan goes ahead, I can imagine it would be an unofficial stepping down, where Mary will still answer to her mother-in-law – it's not altogether different to how things already are,' they said. 'Mary has been taking the reins from Margrethe for a couple of years, she wants to help where she can.' The source added that Mary had 'blossomed' under her mother-in-law's guidance. 'She can finally fulfil her fairytale destiny,' they continued. 'With Margrethe just a short flight away should Mary need her.' Yesterday, Queen Margrethe revealed that she would be stepping down as monarch after 52 years CONTINUING TO CHAMPION CHARITY It is possible that Mary will be encouraged to do more with her foundation following her new role. According to its website, the organisation works to 'fight social isolation based on the belief that everyone has the right to belong'. Initiatives tackle issues including bullying, loneliness and domestic violence. Earlier this month, Mary hinted at her future 'success' and big things to come in a post on the foundation's site and Instagram. The letter was about loneliness and the need for positive human connection during the festive season but offered hints towards something bigger. It is possible that Mary will be encouraged to do more with her foundation following her new role. Pictured during a visit to a school in Denmark in 2022 She added: 'And at the same time, so much has happened that it is impossible to put it all into words.' 'We close 2023 soon and go on Christmas holidays with a gratitude for all that we humans can do when we do it together. We need each other if we are to succeed.' A photo of the royal in the snow was posted alongside the powerful message. She wore a purple jacket beneath a warm woollen wrap and gave a soft smile toward the camera. The royal has also in past shown interest in a number of causes, including humanitarian aid, support for research and science as well as social and health initiatives. Between raising her children and appearing at diplomatic events, Mary has worked tirelessly to prove her commitment to charity, becoming a patron of more than 25 international organisations since her marriage to Frederik in 2004. This includes the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe and the United Nations Population Fund, where she supports their work to promote maternal health in more than 150 developing nations. The royal has also in past shown interest in a number of causes, including humanitarian aid, support for research and science as well as social and health initiatives. Pictured in November According to royal reporter Kenth G. Madsen, Mary will 'play a very prominent role' and 'will not be an invisible queen'. However, he also explained she may, to avoiding straying into political territory, need to be careful with initiatives around women's and children's rights abroad. She and Frederik may also need to encompass causes Margrethe was passionate about, to expand their repertoire - 'so that it is not just the more modern topics'. ENTOURAGE OF FRIENDS? It is not known if Mary will have a new team to advise and support on her new duties as Queen. However, it is likely she will rely on her plethora of tight-knit pals. CAROLINE HEERING Since the Princess married Prince Frederik, Caroline Heering is thought to have been one of her closest friends and confidantes. She has even served as Mary's lady-in-waiting and private secretary. In 2010, Caroline started to dedicate herself to The Mary Foundation, where she occupied the position of official adviser. However, she reportedly stepped down from the board of directors in 2023. It was in 2017 reported that Caroline is married to one of Frederik's childhood friends, Peter, and that the pair have two daughter, Emilie and Rosemarie. TANJA DOKY As Princess Mary's former lady-in-waiting and private secretary, Tanja Doky and the Princess are also understood to have a firm friendship. Tanja worked with the Princess for seven years, eventually leaving Princess Mary to take up a position as communications manager at Maersk Container Industry in 2015. Tanja was married to the famous jazz musician, Chris Minh Doky, and the pair have two children, Frida and Milo. They have since separated, however. BIRGITTE HANDWERK As the partner of one of Prince Frederik's best friends, Jeppe, Birgitte Handwerk was one of Princess Mary's first friends in Denmark. Not only was their friendship formed early on, but they have also shared key experiences over the past decade, insofar as they've both raised young families at the same time. While Birgitte is godmother to Princess Mary's daughter, Josephine, Jeppe is a godfather to her son, Christian. Mary also attended Jeppe and Birgitte's wedding in 2002. VISITING HOME IN AUSTRALIA It is possible that Mary's new duties will affect how often she is able to visit her home in Australia. And the royal appeared very emotional as she wrapped up her pre-Christmas break Down Under earlier this month. Departing from Queenstown Airport in New Zealand after a four-day trip amid a visit to her native Australia, the future Queen appeared to wipe away a tear as she said goodbye to friends and prepared to make the journey back to Denmark. It's not only her homeland, but is also where the royal's love story with her husband began. Mary was 28 years old when she met Frederik in the Slip Inn in Sydney 23 years ago. After the pub encounter, then 32-year-old Fred - who was in Australia to support Denmark's sailing team at the 2000 Olympics - asked Mary for her phone number and a romance blossomed. It is possible that Mary's new duties will affect how often she is able to visit her home in Australia. Pictured in Australia in December 2022 'The first time we met we shook hands. I didn't know he was the prince of Denmark. Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, ""Do you know who these people are""?' Mary revealed in an interview about meeting the heir to the Danish throne. They maintained a long-distance relationship for a year, with Frederik making secret trips Down Under before Mary moved to Denmark to study Danish language at Copenhagen's Studieskolen in 2001. In early 2003, Frederik's mother Queen Margrethe publicly acknowledged the relationship and the couple announced their engagement at Amalienborg Castle later that year on October 8. Frederik and Mary made their first official appearance together at the Tasmania Yacht Club ahead of the Dragon Boat World Championship on January 19, 2003 In a nod to her heritage, during her wedding Mary carried a bouquet of Australian snow gum eucalyptus interspersed with blooms from the Palace garden Frederik and Mary married on May 14, 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral, with the newly minted Crown Princess opting for a beautiful gown by Danish designer Uffer Frank and a veil first used by Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden in 1905. In a nod to her heritage, Mary carried a bouquet of Australian snow gum eucalyptus interspersed with blooms from the Palace garden. The family has returned to Mary's native Australia on many occasions, visiting famous landmarks in Sydney, Canberra and the Northern Territory and even spending Christmas Down Under. ROYAL RESIDENCE Currently, Mary and her family reside in Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg. She and Frederik took over the property from the State in 2010 - when a full refurbishment and restoration was completed after six years. Today, it is their private residence with administrative and ceremonial functions. They also reside at the Chancellery House at Fredensborg Palace. According to royal reporter Kenth G. Madsen, the couple will live in their current accommodation and have no plans to relocate.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12915951/New-year-new-job-Crown-Princess-Mary-Denmark-steps-Queen-following-Margrethes-shock-abdication-Australian-born-royals-life-change.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/01/01/10/79501831-0-image-m-22_1704106050663.jpg,2024-01-01 12:08:38,"Editor, Elmira Tanatarova","['Editor', 'Elmira Tanatarova']",en,gb,0.426
175557089,"DGP, IGP Conference To Be Held In Rajasthan This Week; PM Modi Likely To Attend","New Delhi, Jan 1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend the 58th all-India annual conference of Director Generals and Inspector Generals of Police this week in Rajasthan’s Jaipur to discuss a wide range of issues such as counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency and cyber security. Various other aspects of policing and national security, including strengthening borders, cybercrime, data governance, anti-terrorism challenges, prison reforms, Left-wing extremism or naxalism, and narcotics smuggling, are to be discussed in the conference, in which the Director Generals of Police (DGPs) of different States will present their views in the three-day event scheduled to be held between January 5-7 in different sessions based on separate topics. Sources said that the conference is the culmination of “extensive deliberations involving police and intelligence officers from district, State and national levels on identified themes.” “Best practices from States and Union Territories (UTs) under each of the themes will be presented at the conference so that states can learn from each other,” sources privy to the development said. This would be the first major national conference being held in Jaipur after the formation of the new government in Rajasthan. The National Conference is learnt to be organized at Rajasthan International Center located at Jhalana in Jaipur, said the sources, citing the current schedule. Prime Minister Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Union Ministers of State for Home, National Security Advisor, Union Home Secretary, DGPs and IGPs of States and the UTs, and heads of the Central Police Organisations and Central Armed Police Forces will be present in the conference. About 100 invitees, including DGPs of states and UTs and heads of Central Armed Police Forces and Central Police Organisations, will attend the conference physically, while nearly 600 more officers of various levels are to attend the conference virtually from states and UTs. Since 2014, the Prime Minister has taken a keen interest in the DGP conference. Unlike the symbolic presence of Prime Ministers earlier, PM Modi sits through all major sessions of the conference. The Prime Minister not only listens patiently to all the inputs but also encourages free and informal discussions so that new ideas can come up. This provides a congenial atmosphere for the top police officials of the country to directly brief the Prime Minister on key policing and internal security issues affecting the country and give their open and frank recommendations. Further, guided by the vision of the Prime Minister, the conference has started discussions on futuristic themes in policing and security to ensure not only safety in the present but also to develop a capability to meet emerging issues and challenges. Prime Minister has also encouraged the organisation of annual DGP conferences all across the country since 2014. The conference was organised at Guwahati in 2014; Dhordo, Rann of Kutch in 2015; National Police Academy, Hyderabad in 2016; BSF Academy, Tekanpur in 2017; Kevadiya in 2018; and IISER, Pune in 2019; and at Police Headquarters, Lucknow in 2021; and Delhi in 2022 and 2023. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this conference was organised virtually in 2020. While attending last year’s conference, the Prime Minister suggested making the police forces more sensitive and training them in emerging technologies, emphasising the importance of the National Data Governance Framework for smoothing data exchange across agencies. Prime Minister then stressed the need to further strengthen traditional policing mechanisms like foot patrols while suggesting leveraging technological solutions like biometrics. He then recommended repealing obsolete criminal laws and building standards for police organisations across states, and he suggested prison reforms to improve jail management. The Prime Minister also discussed strengthening border as well as coastal security by organising frequent visits of officials. The Prime Minister then also emphasised enhanced cooperation between state police and central agencies to leverage capabilities and share best practices, and suggested replicating the model of the conference at the state and district levels for discussing emerging challenges and evolving best practices among their teams.

175554473,"Live updates: Israel-Hamas war, Gaza humanitarian crisis","Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are stepping up their strikes on ships in the Red Sea, which they say are revenge against Israel for its military campaign in Gaza. There are fears that the attacks could escalate Israel’s war against Hamas into a wider regional conflict. The US said Sunday that it has no desire to enter a wider war, but that it will act in its own self-defense, after US Navy helicopters sank three Houthi boats that the US says fired on the aircraft in the Red Sea. The helicopters had been responding to a distress call from the latest commercial vessel to come under Houthi fire. The attacks have forced some of the world’s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the world’s most important maritime trade routes, which could potentially cause a shock to the global economy. Here’s what we know about the Houthis: Who are the Houthis? The Houthi movement, also known as Ansarallah (Supporters of God), is one side of the Yemeni civil war that has raged for nearly a decade. It emerged in the 1990s, when its leader, Hussein al-Houthi, launched “Believing Youth,” a religious revival movement for a centuries-old subsect of Shia Islam called Zaidism. His closest followers became known as Houthis. How did they gain power? Ali Abdullah Saleh, the first president of Yemen after the 1990 unification of North and South Yemen, initially supported the Believing Youth. But as the movement’s popularity grew and anti-government rhetoric sharpened, it became a threat to Saleh. Things came to a head in 2003, when Saleh supported the United States invasion of Iraq, which many Yemenis opposed. For al-Houthi, the rift was an opportunity. Seizing on the public outrage, he organized mass demonstrations. After months of disorder, Saleh issued a warrant for his arrest. Al-Houthi was killed in September 2004 by Yemeni forces, but his movement lived on. The Houthi military wing grew as more fighters joined the cause. Emboldened by the early Arab Spring protests in 2011, they took control of the northern province of Saada and called for the end of the Saleh regime. How powerful are the Houthis? American officials have been tracking iterative improvements in the range, accuracy and lethality of the Houthis’ domestically produced missiles. Initially, homegrown Houthi weapons were largely assembled with Iranian components smuggled into Yemen in pieces, an official familiar with US intelligence told CNN previously. But they have made modifications that have added up to big overall improvements, the official said. In a novel development, the Houthis have used medium-range ballistic missiles against Israel, firing a salvo of projectiles at Israel’s southern region of Eilat in early December. Israel said it intercepted the missiles. While the Houthis may not be able to pose a serious threat to Israel, their technology can wreak havoc in the Red Sea. They have used drones and anti-ship missiles to target commercial ships — some of which aren’t believed to be linked to Israel — prompting US Navy and other warships in the Red Sea to respond to distress calls.",https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-01-01-24/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/231228144827-gaza-civilians-swarm-convoy-1228-super-tease.jpg,2024-01-01 12:15:52,Jessie Yeung,['Jessie Yeung'],en,us,0.126
175563391,PGA Tour confirms talks with LIV and DP World Tour extended into 2024,"Negotiations between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) have been extended beyond the original deadline of 31 December. A framework agreement between the organisations, which stunned the world of men’s professional golf, was announced on 6 June and was initially intended to be concluded before the end of 2023. Discussions have been complicated by the emergence of interest from private equity groups, with the PGA Tour announcing on 10 December that it was in discussions with Strategic Sports Group (SSG), an investment group headlined by Liverpool FC’s owner, Fenway Sports Group. In a memo to players sent on 31 December, the PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, said “meaningful progress” had been made with SSG and “productive conversations” continued with the DP World Tour and PIF, which bankrolls the breakaway LIV Golf circuit. “I wanted to provide an update on our negotiations with Strategic Sports Group, the Public Investment Fund and DP World Tour,” Monahan wrote. “As you know, the [PGA Tour policy] board unanimously directed management to pursue exclusive negotiations with SSG. I am pleased to report that we have made meaningful progress and have provided SSG with the due diligence information they requested.” He continued: “As we move forward in our discussions, we are focused on the finalisation of terms and drafts of necessary documents. We also continue our active and productive conversations with PIF and the DP World Tour. While we had initially set a deadline of 31 December 2023 to reach an agreement, we are working to extend our negotiations into next year based on the progress we have made to date. “Our goal for 2024 is to reach agreements with SSG, PIF and the DP World Tour, bringing them on board as minority co-investors in PGA Tour Enterprises. These partnerships will allow us to unify, innovate and invest in the game for the benefit of players, fans and sponsors.” LIV Golf secured a major coup with the signing of Masters champion Jon Rahm on a multimillion-dollar deal last month, despite the world No 3 having previously insisted he was not interested in jumping ship.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/01/pga-tour-confirm-talks-with-dp-world-tour-and-liv-extended-into-2024,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb6d5ceebdb7591a71d9b6662aa3b7de7ac85913/0_175_5279_3169/master/5279.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV,2024-01-01 12:17:18,"Liverpool FC, PA Media","['Liverpool FC', 'PA Media']",en,us,0.25
175556823,New year: Fireworks and street parties ring in 2024 across UK,"The UK marked the beginning of 2024 with fireworks, street parties and a message of inclusivity as people celebrated across Britain. As Big Ben struck midnight drones lit up the London sky with the message ""London, a place for everyone"", before a vibrant firework display began. About 100,000 people gathered to watch the 15-minute spectacular in the city. In Scotland, Britpop band Pulp performed as thousands braved the cold to mark Hogmanay. There was also a firework display as Edinburgh marked its 30th year of the celebrations, while there was a mass ceilidh staged in Inverness. London's display included more than 12,000 fireworks, 600 drones and 430 lights. It quoted Shakespeare, heard from the King and also paid homage to the NHS, which celebrated 75 years in 2023. A quote from King Charles was used to mark the 75th anniversary of the Windrush crossing in which he said new arrivals ""collectively enrich the fabric of our national life"". Further messages throughout the show were heard from Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, Dame Helen Mirren, Bella Ramsey, Stephen Fry, Joanna Lumley, George the Poet, and Baroness Floella Benjamin, who read a poem by the late Benjamin Zephaniah. The celebration will continue later with a New Year's Day parade beginning in Piccadilly at midday before making its way over to Westminster's Parliament Square. Several days of weather warnings did not put off revellers in Scotland with tens of thousands watching Edinburgh's firework display. Visitors from more than 80 countries gathered in the city, while Pulp headlined a concert in Princes Street Gardens. Following the fireworks thousands continued to celebrate, signing Auld Lang Syne and dancing. Inverness was host to the Red Hot Highland Fling, described by organisers as ""one of the biggest ceilidhs on the planet"", where folk singer Siobhan Miller entertained partygoers up to midnight. Later, hundreds of hardy swimmers are expected to brave the waters of the Firth of Forth as part of the annual Loony Dook - dook being a Scots word for dip or bathe. People are encouraged to don fancy dress for the charity swim. In Allendale, Northumberland, the annual Allendale Tar Bar'l ceremony was held. The centuries-old tradition sees 45 local men carry burning whiskey barrels through the town. Before the celebrations King Charles and Queen Camilla waved to onlookers as they attended the New Year's Eve service at a church in Sandringham, Norfolk. Ahead of giving his New Year message the Archbishop of Canterbury urged politicians not to treat their opponents as enemies but as fellow human beings. He told the BBC our capacity ""to disagree deeply and not destructively"" is cause for hope. His message will be broadcast on BBC1 and iPlayer at 12:55 GMT. In his New Year message Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hinted at tax cuts in an election year and said the UK should ""look forward with pride and optimism"". He said his resolution would be to ""keep driving forward"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used his message to say that while it had been ""another tough year economically for millions of people"" hope was ""the fuel of change"".

175557227,"LP, APC trade words over Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation","The leadership of the Labour Party has labelled the reported ‘mechanical completion’ and the ‘flare start-off’ of the country’s biggest crude refinery in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital, as a sham. This was even as the ruling All Progressives Congress cautioned the Labour Party against misleading the public, stressing that it is not every issue that should be politicised. The development comes one week after the Federal Government, through the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Heineken Lokpobiri, announced the near-completion of the Port Harcourt refinery during a media tour on the penultimate Thursday. The two-unit refinery has a combined refining capacity of 210,000 barrels per day, with the old plant having an output of 60,000 barrels per day and the new plant churning out 150,000 bpd. But the leadership of the Labour Party thinks otherwise, insisting that it was another ploy by the APC government to allegedly pull a wool over the faces of Nigerians. In an exclusive chat with our correspondent, the Chief Spokesman for the Labour Party Campaign Organisation, Yunusa Tanko, claimed the party has it on good authority that the start-off of the plant as being reported was stage-managed. He said, “We hear that they have completed the mechanical works. This particular gas flare in Port Harcourt refinery is a deceit. It is another lie to deceive the Nigerian people. We used to know that once we began to have gas flaring up, some oil would be produced at the same time. “But in this case, there is no single oil drop. That’s why we are saying this particular gas flaring they are trying to make everyone talk about is deceit. There was nothing like that. They have not been able to work on that refinery conclusively. It is a lie. “If they are sure about the fact, let them prove us wrong. What happened is that some people just went and switched on the power generator to start up that particular gas flaring to deceive the Nigerian people.” Reacting to the development, Deputy National Organising Secretary of the APC, Nze Chidi Duru, appealed for understanding, saying the operation of the Port Harcourt refinery is a privately funded project, which has nothing to do with the FG. Duru also warned opposition parties to always engage in constructive criticisms with a view to proffering solutions to the myriad problems in the country instead of seeking to score cheap points against the government of the day. “It (refinery) is working and functional. But it has nothing to do with the government because it is a private sector-led initiative. So if the FG has made an announcement that it is working, we have every reason it will work. If it doesn’t work, they know it will damage their brand, and people may no longer believe them. “But as I said earlier, it has nothing to do with the APC government. It is Indorama Petrochemicals that is behind it and not the Federal Government. That was why I said it is not everything we should play politics with in this country. It is a private sector-led initiative,” he stated.",https://punchng.com/lp-apc-trade-words-over-port-harcourt-refinery-rehabilitation/,https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/11111123/APC-and-LP-party-logos.jpg,2024-01-01 12:17:51,"Adebayo Folorunsho, Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis","['Adebayo Folorunsho', 'Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis']",en,ng,-0.679

When there is an opportunity to withdraw a sufficiently large amount of money from risky instruments, they buy real estate, as it belongs to more stable instruments. And we are always happy to help you choose a profitable object, so that a stable instrument will also continue to bring good income"" - shares Evgenia Timofeenko Real estate investing plays an important role in capital preservation. Investors can buy highly liquid properties that can be sold quickly at a good price. Generally, such properties are located in the city center, near attractions, universities, the seaside, and other important infrastructure. Capital appreciation through the purchase of foreign real estate Real estate investments can provide an opportunity for capital appreciation. The strategy typically involves purchasing a property during the excavation stage and selling it upon or shortly after completion. This investment approach can yield returns of 20% to 100% annually, depending on the type of property selected. Moreover, many foreign developers offer installment plans without appreciation, which is advantageous for investors. ""Installment payment without appreciation is a great solution for many investors who cannot pay the entire amount at once when buying an apartment. For example, the housing costs 100 000 dollars and it is necessary to pay 35-70% of the cost at once, and the rest can be paid over several years (maybe until the end of construction or a couple of years). The investor immediately pays a minimum of 35 000 dollars and within 1 year, for example, pays another 20 000 dollars, that is, in fact, invests 55 thousand. After that the house is put into operation and the apartment is sold for 150 000 dollars. In fact, the investor earns 50 000. If you calculate the return on the invested capital, you get 100% per annum,""- Evgeniya gives an example. Obtaining passive income from renting out real estate By investing in real estate you can solve such a problem as passive income. The object can be rented out on a long-term or daily basis When you rent out a residential property abroad for a long period of time, you can earn a minimum of 7% per year. The most important thing is to select the right apartment or house. If you have a good object in a good location, you can earn up to 15% per year by renting it out on a daily basis When buying apartments or villas to rent out, it is best to choose an agency that has its own management company. The investor can live in another country, while his foreign real estate will be handled by specialists: look for clients, run advertising, control payment and solve many other organizational issues. This significantly saves time and nerves for the homeowner. Choosing a real estate object for investment ""If an investor has already decided on a country, we help him or her find a number of profitable objects to invest in. The staff of our Mayak Real Estate agency can also select offers in different countries, if the future investor does not yet have an understanding of where to go. When making a choice, we take into account the budget and the purpose of investment - preservation or multiplication of capital, obtaining passive income. We can also take into account parallel objectives, for example, if the investor wants the apartment to be a backup in case of children's education abroad,""- says Evgenia Timofeenko. The choice of countries for investing in real estate is wide. The most interesting options for potential investors are the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Bali, Thailand, Montenegro, Spain, USA, UK, Portugal. In each of these countries you can find profitable objects from developers for purchase and resale, as well as for purchase and lease for short or long term. If the task is to buy two or more objects for investment, the best solution - diversification, that is, invest in real estate in different countries. It's best to work with the same agent when choosing a property for resale. This ensures that the specialist selects highly liquid options, which sell quickly and at a good price. Determining the purpose of investment is crucial when choosing a property. An experienced agent can assist in identifying the most favorable options for a particular investor's situation.",https://www.kyivpost.com/post/25958,https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2023/12/26/33d7a20a60abac5d38bf99513aec3dcd.png?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg,2024-01-01 12:18:25,Svitlana Danchenko,['Svitlana Danchenko'],en,ua,0.191
175560525,Israeli man indicted for impersonating soldier to join Gaza war reportedly posed with Netanyahu in photo op,"Israeli prosecutors filed criminal charges on Sunday against a man accused of impersonating a soldier to join the Gaza war, stealing munitions and, according to media reports, of posing for a frontline picture with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to the indictment brought in the Tel Aviv District Court, defendant Roi Yifrah never served in the Israeli military, but nonetheless managed to make his way into the war zones by pretending to be a member of an elite Shin Bet security service combat unit.

Channel 12 News aired a photograph of what it said was the 35-year-old posing with other soldiers alongside Netanyahu at a helicopter landing site in full battle gear. An Israeli official confirmed that Yifrah had posed with Netanyahu, but said the prime minister was never at risk due to ""several layers of security at the site."" The Prime Minister's Office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

175563371,Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus convicted of violating Bangladesh’s labour laws,"Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has been convicted of violating Bangladesh’s labour laws in a case decried by his supporters as politically motivated. The 83-year-old is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank, but has earned the enmity of Sheikh Hasina, the longtime prime minister who has accused him of “sucking blood” from poor people. Hasina has made several scathing verbal attacks against the internationally respected 2006 Nobel peace prize winner, who was once seen as a political rival. Yunus and three colleagues from Grameen Telecom, one of the firms he founded, were accused of violating labour laws when they allegedly failed to create a workers’ welfare fund in the company. On Monday, a labour court in the capital, Dhaka, convicted and sentenced them to “six months’ simple imprisonment”, lead prosecutor Khurshid Alam Khan told Agence France-Presse, adding that all four were immediately granted bail pending appeals. All four deny the charges. “I have been punished for a crime that I haven’t committed,” Yunus told reporters after the hearing. “If you want to call it justice, you can.” “This verdict is unprecedented,” said Abdullah Al Mamun, a lawyer for Yunus. “We did not get justice.” Yunus is facing more than 100 other charges over labour law violations and alleged graft. He told reporters after one of the hearings last month that he had not profited from any of the more than 50 social business firms he had set up in Bangladesh. “They were not for my personal benefit,” Yunus said. Another of his lawyers, Khaja Tanvir, said the case was “meritless, false and ill-motivated”. He said: “The sole aim of the case is to harass and humiliate him in front of the world.” Irene Khan, a former Amnesty chief now working as a UN special rapporteur who was present at Monday’s verdict, said the conviction was “a travesty of justice”. “A social activist and Nobel laureate who brought honour and pride to the country is being persecuted on frivolous grounds,” she said. In August, 160 global figures, including former US president Barack Obama and ex-UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, published a joint letter denouncing “continuous judicial harassment” of Yunus. The signatories, including more than 100 of his fellow Nobel laureates, said they feared for his safety and freedom. Critics accuse Bangladeshi courts of rubber-stamping decisions made by Hasina’s government, which is all but certain to win another term in power next week at elections boycotted by the opposition. Her administration has been increasingly firm in its crackdown on political dissent, and Yunus’s popularity among the Bangladeshi public has for years earmarked him as a potential rival. Amnesty International accused the government of “weaponising labour laws” when Yunus went to trial in September and called for an immediate end to his “harassment”. Criminal proceedings against Yunus were “a form of political retaliation for his work and dissent”, the organisation said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/01/nobel-laureate-muhammad-yunus-convicted-bangladesh,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fae60b0e2847d1ea6a8209c25f169651420abbe0/0_329_4932_2959/master/4932.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV,2024-01-01 12:22:52,Agence France-Presse in Dhaka,['Agence France-Presse in Dhaka'],en,us,-0.269

He is also a candidate for NA-130 and challenged the rejection of his nomination papers as well. In his petition, the PAM leader urged the tribunal to strike down the acceptance of Nawaz’s papers as “illegal and unlawful” and that the papers be rejected due to his 2017 disqualification in the Panama Papers case, which the Supreme Court ruled was for The elections will be held February 8 and the preparation has been going as per the schedule.

The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) will host 23 major competitions over the year. With the athletics qualifying window for the Paris 2024 Olympics, scheduled in July-August, already in effect, the events in the first half of the year will also be crucial for the Indian athletes looking to secure a quota for the Paris Olympics. While Indian athletes will be involved in various international athletics meets this year, competing at home under familiar conditions will give them a better chance of breaching the Olympic qualifying standards or improving their rankings in their respective events. The Paris 2024 qualification and ranking period for all individual events - other than the marathon - will run till June 30. The qualification period for the marathon is till April 30, 2024. Indian track and field athletes can hope for a busy month in March with the India Open 400m, jumps and throws competitions on the agenda, in addition to the inaugural National Open Relay Carnival in Chandigarh.

175562231,"Not our job to win referendums for the government, says chief exec of new electoral authority","THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE of Ireland’s new electoral authority has emphasised that it is not its job to win referendums for the government, as Ireland plans to hold every type of poll there is in the next 20 months. Two referendums are to be held in March on whether the Irish constitution should be changed to provide for a wider concept of family, and on whether to delete a reference to the role and duties of women in the home and replace it with a new article on carers. Local authority and European Parliament elections are to be held in June and a general election could be called in 2024 – although ministers have emphasised that they want the coalition to run its full term to the spring of 2025. Added to that is the presidential election in 2025, the Seanad elections and several by-elections, as well as a new vote on a directly elected mayor for Limerick city. The Electoral Commission, which was established in February 2023 after 30 years of governments suggesting the idea, is to provide information on and encourage people to engage in elections and referendums. While acknowledging the challenges ahead, including on how to tackle disinformation, chief executive of the Electoral Commission Art O’Leary is not worried about resources. He hopes to encourage people who are fed up with politicians to use their vote. “We need to be eye-wateringly ambitious,” he told the PA news agency a day after moving into new offices. “I like to look at them (the series of elections) as a glorious opportunity for learning and to collect data. “We’re kicking off a longitudinal study of electoral events which is to last, I’m projecting, for the next 25 years. “We don’t know why people don’t vote and we don’t really know what the turnout rate is. “We need to understand why people vote the way they do, and we need to understand if they have enough information to be able to cast their vote – we have no information on this.” Once the Bill on the referendum wording passes both houses of the Oireachtas, the commission will formally launch its campaign to explain in layman’s terms what the government is proposing. The campaign will involve encouraging people to ensure they are on the electoral register, giving information about the referendum wording and then encouraging people to go out to use their vote on the day. O’Leary said 16-page booklets will be delivered to two million households across the country, at least a week ahead of the plebiscites on Friday 8 March. Although the referendums are being proposed by the government, O’Leary emphasised that the commission was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas. O’Leary said that it is “politically blind” to political parties and its job is to be “independent and impartial”. Art O'Leary PA PA “Our job isn’t to win this referendum for the government. Our job is simply to explain to the people what the referendum is all about, and people can make up their own mind. This is what democracy is all about,” he said. The Electoral Commission does not yet have the powers to act in relation to online political advertising, disinformation or misinformation in time for the referendums in March, and possibly not in time for the summer elections. Though those powers are contained in parts four and five of Bill, they have yet to be commenced, O’Leary said. But other powers the commission has may allow it to act on something that “is not right”. Asked what would happen if there is incorrect information on a poster, O’Leary said they would not be able to take down the posters as their powers relate to online information only, but they could release a statement to set the record straight. “We’ll call it out, I think that’s probably as much as we can do,” he said. Asked whether they would consider setting up a disinformation register, as Australia’s Electoral Commission has, he said: “We may do, it’s certainly an option. “It is our job to provide trusted information to people and if we’re calling out disinformation and saying ‘what this person is saying, or what these people are saying is simply not correct’, then we may look at putting that on our website in a single place where people can go.” He added: “The challenge for us is speed. During the white-hot heat of an election campaign, we don’t have time to sit back and luxuriate about whether something is misinformation or disinformation or not, because hours or even minutes might be important here. “And this is why we need to build an organisation that is flexible enough and responsive enough to be able to manage those challenges. “The technical challenge is we’ll still be writing the review of the referendum electoral experience during the local and European Parliament one, so the opportunity to learn from one to another won’t be maximised. “We can’t look at this in isolation, the next two years are going to be extraordinarily busy, we accept that, but we’re building an organisation that’s going to last 100 years. “People look back at the elections in 1981 and 1982, we had three general elections in 18 months then and the ceiling didn’t fall in – we’ll manage it.” He added: “I’m not concerned about resources. We have enough people to do what we need to do for the moment, anyway.” O’Leary, who has a five-year contract in the role, spent seven years as secretary general to the President of Ireland and 20 years in Leinster House in various civil servant roles. He designed the model for Citizens’ Assemblies and has run three of the six held to date, and advised on the others. Asked about disillusioned parts of the electorate, he said: “I was at the Citizens’ Assembly on drug use during the summer, and one of the speakers there was a man who worked in an addiction treatment centre treating addicts. “He said something that profoundly affected my thinking about this whole issue. He said ‘there is no such thing as hard to reach people or hard to reach groups, there are only hard to reach services’. “So I think that we’ve been looking at this issue from the wrong end of the telescope for a long time – and we might say, ‘How will we get them to come to us?’. That’s not the challenge – we have to be in their communities. “So we need to be on TikTok. We need to be on social media. We need to be telling the story in a way that appeals to young people and Travellers and immigrants and all of the people who are disillusioned and disengaged.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/electoral-commission-polls-referendums-6261710-Jan2024/,https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6261710/river/?height=400&version=6261711,2024-01-01 12:26:12,View all articles,['View all articles'],en,ie,0.079
175557217,Israel to pull some troops from Gaza as war enters new phase,"Israel is withdrawing some forces from Gaza to shift to more targeted operations against Hamas, and is partially returning reservists to civilian life to help the economy as the war looks set to last well into the new year, an Israeli official said. The official said toppling the Islamist faction remained an objective of the offensive in the Palestinian enclave, and that some of the five brigades withdrawn will prepare for a possible flare-up of a second front against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Since launching the war in retaliation for the cross-border Hamas rampage of Oct. 7, Israeli officials have said they would wage it in three main stages. The first was intense shelling to clear access routes for ground forces and encourage civilians to evacuate. The second was the invasion that began on Oct. 27. With tanks and troops having now overrun much of the Gaza Strip, largely asserting control despite Palestinian gunmen continuing their ambushes from hidden tunnels and bunkers, the military is moving to the third stage, said the official, who could not be named in print given the sensitivity of the issue. ""This will take six months at least, and involve intense mopping-up missions against the terrorists. No one is talking about doves of peace being flown from Shajaia,"" the official told Reuters, referring to a Gaza district ravaged by fighting. In addition to the 1,200 people killed on Oct. 7, Hamas took some 240 hostage. Israel is also determined to recover the 129 still held in Gaza. Qatari- and Egyptian-mediated truce efforts have raised the prospect of some of them being freed. The shift appeared to correspond to pressure from Israel's top ally, the United States, to review tactics and do more to protect non-combatants. BOLSTERING ECONOMY Israel initially drafted 300,000 reservists - some 10% to 15% of its workforce - for what looks set to be its longest-ever war. Government sources have said between 200,000 and 250,000 reservists were still mobilised and absent from jobs or studies. The official said two of the brigades being withdrawn were made up of reservists, and described the move as designed to ""re-energise the Israeli economy"". Local media have reported that several military divisions were deployed throughout Gaza. The official added that some of the troops pulled out of Gaza in the south would be prepared for rotation to the northern border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has warned that, if Hezbollah does not back down, a full-on Lebanon war looms. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range attacks against Israel. ""The situation on the Lebanese front will not be allowed to continue. This coming six-month period is a critical moment,"" the official said, adding that Israel would convey a similar message to a U.S. envoy conducting shuttle missions to Beirut. In Gaza, the Israel-Hamas war has inflicted unprecedented devastation, with the health ministry reporting almost 22,000 fatalities, many of them civilian. Israel says it has killed more than 8,000 Palestinian fighters - suggesting that, by its own accounting, Hamas retains core personnel. Pre-war Israeli assessment were that the group had around 30,000 fighters. The Israeli military announced on Saturday it was sending some reservists home as part of what top commander Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi has deemed a ""reconfiguration"" of forces. ""From the first moments of this war, we said it would take long,"" Halevi told troops on Tuesday. ""Will we ultimately be able to say there are no more foes around the State of Israel? I think that is overly ambitious. But we will deliver a different security situation - safe and, as much as possible, stable too."" Israel has listed 174 soldiers - many of them reservists - as killed in Gaza fighting and nine on the Lebanese border.",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/israel-to-pull-some-troops-from-gaza-as-war-enters-new-phase-9090580/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/israel-1.jpg,2024-01-01 12:28:50,,[],en,in,-0.345
175573679,"Legal pot, abortion rights and paid leave: A whirlwind year at the Minnesota Legislature","By late last spring, the rush of headlines coming out of Minnesota’s Capitol seemed like it might never stop. Marijuana legalization. Paid family and medical leave. New legal protections for abortion. Universal school meals. Free college tuition. A mandate for a new state flag. Minnesota’s whirlwind 2023 legislative session is likely to go down as one of the most consequential in a generation. And while some of the new laws have already gone into effect, the impacts of many of the new policies won’t be seen for years. In November 2022, voters gave the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party majorities in both the Senate and House, and another four-year term to DFL Gov. Tim Walz, clearing the path for a sweeping agenda held back by years of divided government. With little leverage, Republicans who had once controlled the Senate could only sit back and watch as members of the DFL “trifecta” swiftly pursued their agenda. So much new legislation was enacted it might be tough to remember everything that happened at the Capitol this year. Here’s a look back at what went down: Abortion One of the first major bills of 2023 made it to the governor’s desk in the first month of the session. The Protect Reproductive Options Act, or PRO ACT, codified the right to abortion in state law. Later in the year, lawmakers removed restrictions such as a 24-hour wait period and parental disclosure requirement from statute. Juneteenth Minnesota now recognizes Juneteenth, the celebration of the end of slavery in the United States, as a state holiday. June 19th became a federal holiday in 2021. Clean energy A bill signed into law in February will require Minnesota to shift all its electricity to carbon-free sources by 2040. Felon voting rights More than 50,000 people with felony convictions on supervised release in Minnesota are now eligible to vote under a new state law. Secretary of State Steve Simon, the state’s top elections official, said it was Minnesota’s “largest single act of enfranchisement” since the voting age changed from 21 to 18 half a century ago. In February the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the felon voting ban. Justices acknowledged the disparate impact but ruled the law was still constitutional, sending the issue back to the Legislature. Felons could start registering to vote on June 1 and the law has so far survived challenges from a conservative legal group. 'Driver's Licenses For All' After a two-decade ban, more than 80,000 Minnesota residents who are in the U.S. illegally will be able to obtain a driver’s license again. The “Driver’s Licenses For All” bill, which removed the requirement for license applicants to provide proof of citizenship or lawful presence in the country, went into effect Oct. 1. Catalytic converters Lawmakers moved to address an explosion in catalytic converter thefts from vehicles. It’s now a crime to remove a catalytic converter from a vehicle without labeling it with the vehicle identification number. Universal school meals As of the beginning of the school year, Minnesota K-12 students started getting school meals at no charge. The program was estimated to cost about $200 million a year, but with more students participating than originally expected, it’s already going to cost $81 million more than planned by the end of 2025. In 2026-2027 it could cost $95 million more, according to state budget officials. LGBT youth Minnesota now protects transgender youth access to treatments like hormone replacements, therapy and other procedures known as gender-affirming care. So-called conversion therapy, treatments aimed at changing a person’s sexual orientation, is no longer permitted for minors in Minnesota. Elections bill A significant number of Minnesotans will now be automatically registered to vote in future elections. And 16- and 17-year-olds will be eligible to preregister to vote. The state now also has new penalties for spreading election disinformation. In addition, the “Democracy for the People Act” signed into law in May creates new independent campaign spending requirements and restricts “foreign-influenced” corporations from contributing to campaigns, though that provision has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Free college tuition Under the new higher education budget, students from families earning less than $80,000 a year are now eligible for free public college tuition after federal aid and grants. PFAS ban Chemicals known as PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, were already banned in food packaging but will be banned from a wider range of products in the coming years. They’re called “forever chemicals” because they build up in organisms and persist in the environment. Sick time On Jan. 1, nearly all Minnesota workers are entitled to 48 hours of leave each year for health and safety reasons. Under the law, employers must allow employees to earn at least one hour of paid safe and sick time for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours per year. The law covers all employees, including part-time and temporary workers. Gun control Universal background checks for firearm sales are now required in Minnesota. And if a person is deemed dangerous by authorities or immediate family, a court can issue an order to take their guns away through an “extreme risk protection order.” Infrastructure With just days left in the session, Minnesota lawmakers approved a $2.6 billion public infrastructure borrowing bill. The bonding will help pay for roads, water treatment plants and public buildings. Biggest ever surplus, budget Minnesota had a record $17.5 billion budget surplus in the beginning of 2023, and by May the governor and DFL lawmakers had put together a record $72 billion budget that raised spending by close to 38% percent over the previous biennial budget. “It’s going to mean a fairer, more inclusive, better and more prosperous Minnesota,” Walz said when he signed the budget's major components into law. “We’re leaving no one behind.” Republicans decried the big spending boost and billions in new taxes despite the surplus. By the end of the year, state budget officials said the state has a $2.4 billion surplus, but warned of shortfalls ahead if the state isn’t careful about spending. Rebates In May the governor signed a tax bill authorizing $1.1 billion in one-time tax rebates for more than 2 million Minnesotans. In the end, total payments came in below $1 billion. In November, the Minnesota Department of Revenue reissued nearly 150,000 one-time tax rebate checks that went uncashed or had expired. Single filers earning up to $75,000 a year were eligible for $260 checks, joint filers earning up to $150,000 were eligible for $520 checks, and households got $260 for each dependent up to three. A married couple with three children could receive up to $1,300. Transportation taxes Minnesota’s per-gallon gasoline tax is expected to go up by 5 cents by 2027, vehicle registration fees are going up, and each delivery will now have a 50-cent fee – though with some exceptions such as for medication. Paid family and medical leave Minnesota is on its way to creating a tax-funded, state-administered paid family and medical leave program for workers. A state program in the works will offer 12 weeks of family leave and 12 weeks of medical leave with a 20-week annual cap. All businesses would be required to participate or offer equivalent benefits. Benefits start in 2026. Legal marijuana Minnesota legalized recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older this year, making it the 23rd state to do so. The state will also expunge marijuana convictions, and create new regulations for the substance. Possession and small-scale growing became legal on Aug. 1, but it will take longer for dispensaries to open. New state flag Minnesota got a new state flag and seal this year. State lawmakers passed a bill creating a commission to explore options that wrapped up its work in December. They’ll become official on statehood day, May 11, unless the Legislature intervenes.",https://www.twincities.com/2024/01/01/minnesota-legislature-review-legal-pot-abortion/,https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AP23144588017665.jpg?w=1024,2024-01-01 12:29:23,Alex Derosier,['Alex Derosier'],en,us,-0.333
175573663,"Pakistan Elections 2024: With Imran out of the Game, an Attempt To Bowl Out PTI","The stage is being set for the election of members to Pakistan’s 16th National Assembly on 8 February 2024.The Army Generals, always the scenic designers, are busy creating a fake setting to ensure the return of Nawaz Sharif’s unpopular Pakistan Muslim League (N) and the decimation of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the apparent choice of the masses.Having survived an assassination attempt in November 2022, PTI’s charming leader Imran Khan is now in jail. Following his arrest, protests by his supporters turned into violent riots with several Army installations being attacked. The Generals of Pakistan: Army Chief Asim Munir’s Charm Offensive in the USThe Army crackdown resulted in the arrest, torture, and disappearance of thousands of PTI workers. The arrested PTI leaders were given a choice: jump ship, join another party, or retire from politics – else rot in jail. Hordes of threatened leaders deserted the party.These included the suave Asad Umar, the Minister for Planning, Development, Reforms, and Special Initiatives in Imran Khan’s cabinet. With the latter interned, Umar, a brilliant strategist and organiser, was seen as PTI’s prime ministerial candidate. But he chose to retire from politics.Lately, the Election Commission of Pakistan, batting for the establishment, declared PTI’s intra-party elections null and void for not complying with the Elections Act and the party’s own constitution. A list of registered parties released by the EC removed the name of Imran Khan as PTI’s party head and shows PTI as a leaderless party. Further, the electoral watchdog stripped PTI of its symbol: a cricket bat.Cancelling the poll symbol would deprive the party of the reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. On 26 December, the Peshawar High Court passed an order reinstating PTI’s election symbol. Instead of adhering to the high court’s directive, the EC has filed a review petition with the court. The petition is scheduled to be reviewed on 9 January.Imran Khan Re-Arrest: A Case Of Overconfidence Trumping Political MileageIn spite of all the roadblocks being placed before PTI, the party remains popular with the masses.Feeling the nerve of the people, the establishment and its caretaker government are leaving no stone unturned to try and ensure a two-thirds majority for Nawaz Sharif’s party. Pakistani social media is abuzz with reports of Army Chief General Syed Asim Munir's meeting with the chairman of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), the government agency responsible for issuing National Identity Cards to Pakistani citizens. The Army Chief is supposed to have given directions to create a minimum of 15,000 bogus votes in each of the 266 parliamentary constituencies by issuing counterfeit voter identification cards made in the name of deceased voters and overseas Pakistanis – 99% of who never exercise their voting right. Data is also available on resident Pakistanis who have been issued voter cards but never vote. Duplicate cards will be made for such voters and given to collaborators for possible use. It is said that the chairman of NADRA, unhappy with these instructions, leaked the details of the meeting.Nawaz Sharif's Return: Pakistan is Unlikely to Break Out of Its Praetorian TrapWhile making sure that there is no level playing field for the PTI, the government continues to dole out unfair advantages to other major parties. On 30 December, the Central Power Purchasing Agency released Rs 74 billion to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) – many of which are owned by the Sharif family and the Zardari group. There are 42 IPPs in Pakistan – 14 of which belong to powerful political families with retired military officers or their family members as partners. These 14 companies rule the roost. They have monopolised licences to import Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) and Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). The very same companies also hold licences for the export and import of wheat and sugar. No new company can get a licence for LNG or LPG import or the import/export of sugar and wheat. The release of funds by the government to IPPs will further strengthen the election war chest of the Sharifs and Zardaris. The establishment has clearly ganged up against the PTI.Given the surge in public sympathy for Imran Khan and his party, the PTI may still turn the tables on the establishment.Leading the PTI is Barrister Gohar Ali Khan who, abandoning the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), joined PTI in July 2022. A fellow Huskie from the University of Washington Law School, he is not widely known in political circles. He is also said to lack ""dynamism” – which should suit Imran.Even the parties opposing PTI do not seem to be confident of victory. Aitzaz Ahsan, a veteran political observer in Pakistan, has predicted that Nawaz Sharif will leave the country before the elections and watch the results unfold from abroad.(Akhil Bakshi a Fellow of Royal Geographical Society, Fellow of Explorers Club USA, and Editor of Indian Mountaineer, has authored 27 books including three on Tibet: Silk Road on Wheels, Train to Lhasa, and Stairway to Heaven.

175559123,Study Abroad: Top scholarship programmes for Indian students,"Ashutosh Burnwal The trend of Indian students pursuing studies abroad has experienced a remarkable resurgence post-decline of the Covid pandemic. This is evident in the recent statistics released by the Ministry of Education. The data reveals a significant upswing in the number of Indian students undertaking higher education overseas, soaring to 750,365 as compared to 444,553 students in 2021. Despite an increasing number of students heading abroad for higher studies, the tuition fees and cost of living are still pretty high for Indian students. It often serves as the decisive factor for students in their academic pursuits overseas. While the steep tuition fees pose a concern, the cost of accommodation can be particularly staggering for students seeking affordable alternatives. For instance, the average tuition fee for undergraduate programmes in the USA and Canada is approximately Rs 40 lakh and Rs 19 lakh, respectively. However, the cost of accommodation for a four-year programme in these countries hover around Rs 48 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, respectively. Given the overall high cost of expenditures associated with pursuing studies overseas, it is prudent for students to explore scholarship opportunities proactively while conceptualising their dreams. Given below are some of the distinguished scholarship programmes that Indian students must consider in their quest for international education: Fulbright-Nehru Master's Fellowships Programme Administered by the United States-India Educational Foundation (USIEF), this programme provides funding to Indian students who are pursuing their Master's degree programme in the United States.

175562249,Covid Sub-Variant JN.1: INSACOG Says 196 Cases Detected In India,"NEW DELHI, Jan 1: A total of 196 cases of COVID-19 sub-variant JN.1 have been detected in the country so far, with Odisha joining the list of states that have detected the presence of the variant, according to the INSACOG’s (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium) data updated on January 1. Ten states and Union territories have so far detected the presence of the JN.1 sub-variant of the virus. These states are Kerala (83), Goa (51), Gujarat (34), Karnataka (eight), Maharashtra (seven), Rajasthan (five), Tamil Nadu (four), Telangana (two) Odisha (one) and Delhi (one), according to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG). The INSACOG’s data showed 179 Covid cases recorded in the country in December had the presence of JN.1, while 17 such cases were detected in November. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has classified JN.1 as a separate “variant of interest” given its rapidly-increasing spread, but said it poses a “low” global public health risk. The JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus was previously classified as a variant of interest (VOI) as part of the BA.2.86 sub-lineages, the parent lineage that is classified as a VOI, the world body said. However, in recent weeks, JN.1 cases continued to be reported from multiple countries and its prevalence has rapidly increased globally. The Centre has asked the states and Union territories to maintain a constant vigil amid an uptick in the number of Covid cases and the detection of the JN.1 sub-variant in the country. India has recorded 636 new coronavirus infections, while the active cases stood at 4,394, according to the data released by the Health Ministry on January 1.

175563367,"Transfer window opens: the latest football news, rumours and done deals – live","The Observer asked fans of all 20 Premier League clubs for their January wish-lists. Let’s take a look, starting (predictably enough) with Arsenal and Aston Villa. Arsenal FFP is a factor here. If we can’t count on the fitness of Thomas Partey, perhaps the Saudis can tempt him. I’m hoping we’re not forced to flog the homegrown likes of Emile Smith Rowe, but frankly, with everyone chasing a proven goalscorer, selling Fábio Vieira etc won’t make much of a dent in the fee demanded for Ivan Toney or Dominic Solanke. Elsewhere, Douglas Luiz won’t be the only Villa player coveted by plenty of clubs, but I just can’t see how we stump up £100m for him. Based on his impressive pre-season form, I’d settle for Jurriën Timber’s early recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in the opening game; he’ll feel like a new signing and might well energise our squad in the finishing straight. Bernard Azulay onlinegooner.com Aston Villa Do we stick or twist? Does swinging the bat now risk overpaying and disrupting a harmonious dressing room, or is it irresponsible not to have a proper go when this might be our best chance of the Champions League – or even the title – for years? We have good cover in most positions apart from the hardest two to fill: reserve keeper and back-up centre-forward. Solanke is a great age, it would mean we could slightly adapt styles and he seems like a nice boy. But he’s not cheap and would he come to initially play second fiddle? Personally I’d play 13th fiddle for anyone if they doubled my wages, but anyway. Unai Emery will have lined up two or three fine Europeans I’ve never heard of, and of course the really good teams strengthen in areas where they’re already strong, so I won’t be overanalysing his logic, such is my unconditional faith in the man. I’ll be happy whatever he does.

175560893,Couple treat pet pigs to bubble baths and organic smoothies - and let them sleep in their bed,"Meet the pampered pigs who are treated to bubble baths, organic smoothies and even sleep in their owner's bed. Mini pigs Penelope Rose, five, and Daisy Dukes, two months, are ""spoilt"" by their loving owners, Jacey and Marcus Tinsley. The couple, both 32, let their pet porkers run riot around their house - and say their lives ""revolve around the pigs"". Penelope - who tips the scales at 80lbs - loves a spa day and will get her hair cut and brushed, nails painted and dolled up in a tutu. Little Daisy weighs just 5lbs but will grow to a similar size as her 'big sister' and loves to snuggle up to the couple in bed and charge around the house. Jacey and Marcus, a singer, say the two pigs are ""best friends"" and they couldn't imagine their lives without them. Jacey, a content creator, from Phoenix, Arizona, US, said: ""They run the show here. ""They sleep in bed with us. Daisy wakes me up in the middle of the night nibbling my ear. ""The get on the couch and watch movies. ""They are our world. Our lives revolve around them."" Pig lover Jacey asked Marcus if they could get a pet hog and after he agreed the pair spent time researching if it was possible. Jacey said: ""I have always loved pigs. ""I never thought it was possible to get pet pigs."" They brought Penelope home at eight weeks old in 2018 - after splashing out £950 on her. In November 2023 they brought home Daisy to join their family - spending £500 on her. Jacey said: ""We wanted to make sure we could handle them all. ""They are best friends. They are adorable."" The couple say the pigs have different personalities. Marcus said: ""Penelope is the most chill, relaxed lazy pig. ""Daisy is a little firecracker."" Every morning the pigs are fed organic veggies and pig pellets - and the couple say they don't spend more than £100 on food for them per month. Marcus said: ""Sometimes I share Cheerios and we eat together. ""They have our smoothies sometimes too. ""Essentially they are like having a toddler."" The pigs have a weekly bubble bath and Penelope also gets a spa day - which she loves. She also loves to get dressed up - donning tutus and hats. Marcus said: ""Penelope is a diva. She gets her haircut, nails painted. ""She loves the glitz and glam."" Jacey added: ""She gets her hair brushed and lotion on her."" Daisy isn't so keen on spa days but adores the couple's daughter, Taylee, 12. Jacey said: ""Taylee is crazy about them."" The couple didn't leave Penelope for five years and only did so for the first time last year. Instead, they took her everywhere they went - on holiday, walks and to the shops. Marcus said: ""When we first got Penelope we took her on holidays. ""We snuck her into hotels. ""We took them to the malls."" Now the couple have a ""pig palace"" in their bedroom for the pets to go in when they nip out for an errand - full of blankets. They also have a pig sitter if they go away for a longer period of time. The couple hope to expand their pig family and hope to one day open a pig rescue. Jacey said: ""It's a full happy house. ""I can't remember a time before pigs. ""We wouldn't trade it for the world. ""We're crazy about them."" Marcus added: ""I never thought I'd be in love with pigs, but here we are.""

175561171,We’re Committed To Completing All Ongoing Projects – Gov Buni,"The Yobe State governor Hon. Mai Mala Buni said his administration remained committed to ensuring the completion of all ongoing projects in addition to initiating more developmental projects this year. Buni stated this while signing the 2024 budget into law as passed by the Yobe State House of Assembly at the WAWA Hall Government House Damaturu. The governor who commended the Speaker and the members house for the timely passage of the 2024 budget said the measure will enable his government to hit the new year with great determination and commitment in meeting the needs of the people. “You will also recall that during the budget presentation to the state assembly, l assured the good people of the state that the government would complete all ongoing projects and initiate new ones. “Let me seize this opportunity to once again reassure you that the government in the new year, shall focus on the completion of the ongoing projects and funding of new ones, thereby prioritizing key sectors and programmes that directly impact on the lives of our citizens. “The provision of roads and other basic infrastructure for multi-faceted development would continue to be given priority attention. We would ensure the completion of Potiskum and Geidam Modern Markets, Potiskum Trailer Park, and the Damaturu Mega Shopping Mall as well as rehabilitation, upgrading and capitalization of all the Government-owned companies among others. “The completion of the sesame seeds processing and packaging factories in Damaturu, Potiskum, Machina and Nguru towns is very key to our administration towards providing employment opportunities, and local revenue drive. We will therefore ensure their completion and take-off soon. “The government would continue to provide a conducive working atmosphere for civil servants and public office holders to be more responsive to our current demands for speedy and effective implementation of our people-oriented policies and programmes. “I would like to enjoin all public office holders and civil servants to be proactive in our quest to improve the lives of our people and to uphold the values of transparency, accountability, due process and financial discipline in the implementation of the 2024 budget for the benefit of our people,”Buni added.

175563737,The combat sports power rankings 2024: Boxing and MMA’s 50 most influential figures,"The landscapes in boxing and mixed martial arts are perhaps the most treacherous in all of sports, with fighters not always possessing the power, which is instead often held in the hands of managers, promoters and broadcasters. Below, The Independent has taken a look at where the control lies, also factoring in the fighters who have been able to use their talent and popularity to carve out their own influence. The result? Rankings of the 50 most influential figures in combat sports. The list is of course subjective, with many fair arguments to be made about the placement of each name, and we’ve gone beyond boxing and MMA in certain cases. On that note, let’s kick off the rankings with... Jiu-jitsu’s popularity worldwide is growing rapidly, with the grappling-centric martial art featuring heavily in MMA contests and now having a young star in its own right: Gordon Ryan. The American is just 28 – do not let his dyed grey hair and beard deceive you – and is already regarded as the greatest no-Gi competitor in the history of the sport. A multiple-time world champion, Ryan has controversially advocated performance-enhancing drugs in combat sports, but many jiu-jitsu practitioners look up to the American anyway. With time, Joe Rogan has spent less time at the UFC commentary desk, and Anik has emerged as the true, modern voice of the promotion. A consummate professional, the 45-year-old American essentially leads UFC broadcasts in between calling the fights, and he has provided numerous calls that have defined some of the greatest moments in MMA history. The other voice of the UFC. Buffer, the brother of a famous Michael, has emulated the boxing ring announcer’s success but in MMA. While Michael has his own legendary catchphrase (more on that later), Bruce has become beloved for his emphatic, “It’s time!”, his contageous energy, and his flashy suits. He is a key part of what makes a UFC title fight feel monumental. Benn, son of British boxing great Nigel, was forging a solid pro career in his own right until his fight with Chris Eubank Jr – a strange sort of third part to the Nigel vs Chris Sr rivalry – fell apart in 2022. That bout collapsed after it was revealed that Benn, 27, had failed two drug tests, and he is still unable to box in Britain as a result. However, the saga – in which he has maintained his innocence – has bolstered Benn’s profile and made more fans care about him, even if many are rooting for him to fail. The fight with Eubank Jr, should it ever materialise, would be huge. His back-to-back bouts with Conor McGregor in 2016 made Diaz a crossover star, when he was already a UFC fan favourite. The American, now 38, remains a pay-per-view draw, and he recently crossed over in a different way, boxing Jake Paul in August. Diaz came up short that night but secured another major payday, and fans eagerly anticipate his next move – with many hoping that it will be a long-awaited trilogy fight against McGregor. Diaz is no longer signed to the UFC, however, meaning a new deal would need to be hashed out. The American boxing coach works with welterweight star Errol Spence Jr and rising lightweight Ryan Garcia, and he even trained Anthony Joshua for the Briton’s bouts with Jermaine Franklin and Robert Helenius in 2023. Spence Jr and Garcia suffered defeats in high-profile fights last year – to Terence Crawford and Gervonta Davos respectively – but remains one of the most in-demand coaches around. Davis is the chairman of the Professional Fighters League, which has emerged as the main rival to the UFC in recent years. The 61-year-old American has overseen the PFL’s purchase of Bellator – the UFC’s former chief competitor – and deals with Jake Paul and Francis Ngannou. Having those names on the PFL’s roster should make for an intriguing 2024. Britain’s second UFC champion ever, Edwards is a great ambassador for MMA in his home nation and for the sport in general. The welterweight title holder has a remarkable life story, having escaped deadly conditions in Jamaica – his country of birth – with his mother and younger brother, before beginning the journey that would lead him to UFC gold. To win the welterweight title in 2022, Edwards produced one of the greatest knockouts in UFC history. Although he is a talented young lightweight, Garcia does not seem to be on the level of some of his fellow American stars in the division. However, he is a skilled commodity – seemingly a geuine pay-per-view draw – and could follow his 2023 loss to Gervonta Davis with fights against Devin Haney and Teofimo Lopez. An all-time great in the boxing ring, the 45-year-old is the sport’s only eight-division world champion. His clash with Floyd Mayweather in 2015 – several years too late, admittedly – remains the highest-grossing pay-per-view in boxing history. That record looks likely to stand for many years to come. The Filipino also served as a senator in his home country from 2016 until 2022, but he fought professionally as recently as 2021. Some see Terence Crawford as boxing’s pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport is among those to award that honour to Inoue, the four-weight world champion from Japan. The fittingly-nicknamed “Monster” recently became undisputed in a second division, as the only man other than Crawford to achieve that feat, and his stoppage rate is even more impressive than the American’s. Speed, power, imagination – the 30-year-old has it all. A breakout MMA star in 2021, with his profile only growing in the two years since, the Brazilian has enjoyed such success relatively later in his career. Oliveira, now 34, was 31 when he won the UFC lightweight title and was already 39 fights into his pro career. “Do Bronx” has since lost the belt but is still on an impressive run overall, and he could yet regain the gold in 2024... The American is one of the hardest-hitting punchers in boxing history, with that asset aiding him in his long reign as WBC heavyweight champion. Wilder, 38, was finally beaten in 2020, when Tyson Fury stopped the “Bronze Bomber” – before repeating the trick in 2021 – and now appears to be past his peak. Wilder was comprehensively outboxed and outpointed in December, as Joseph Parker dealt the American a damaging blow and potentially cost him a long-awaited clash with Anthony Joshua. One of heavyweight boxing’s true icons, Tyson has found new relevancy in recent years with his Hotboxin’ podcast. It has allowed the American, 57, to show off a different, more relaxed side to himself. It is a side that people seem to love. There are a couple of names later on this list who vie for the title of ‘the greatest ever’ in women’s boxing, but the best right now? Surely Shields, although her ‘GWOAT’ nickname tells you all you need to know about how highly the American rates herself. Shields, still just 28, has already become undisputed in two weight classes and unified champion in another. So, she has earnt the right to rate herself so highly. One of the greatest featherweights in MMA history, and the consensus pound-for-pound No 1 until recently. The Australian has been dominant at 145lbs, where he is UFC champion, and his only defeats over the last decade both came in 2023 – with the 35-year-old losing a narrow decision to lightweight champion Islam Makhachev in February, before suffering a knockout against the Russian in October. Even in the latter instance, though, “Alexander The Great” rightly received credit for stepping up on short notice. The most famous MMA journalist on the planet, Helwani is more easily recognisable than many fighters, in fact. The Canadian was an insider long before his stint at ESPN, and he has continued to thrive even since leaving the network. Indeed, Helwani has thrived in spite of being banned from live events by the UFC, with many fighters desperate to appear on his YouTube show, The MMA Hour, as a result of the immense exposure that it guarantees. Helwani has also dipped his toe into NBA and boxing coverage. The US promoter, 63, counts world champion Amanda Serrano among his fighters, as well as ex-champions George Kambosos Jr and Regis Prograis. DiBella may not be as well known as some of the promoters that you’ll find later on this list, but his influence is still significant. One of MMA’s few, genuine crossover stars since McGregor hit and passed his peak. Many fans doubted whether “Sugar Sean” could match his popularity with in-ring success, feeling that the sniper striker might be let down by holes elsewhere in his game. Those doubts were undermined, however, when O’Malley knocked out wrestling specialist Aljamain Sterling in round two in August, becoming the UFC men’s bantamweight champion in the process. The voice of boxing. For decades, the 79-year-old has stood out as the sport’s most famous ring announcer, in large part due to his catchphrase, “Leeeeeeeeet’s get ready to ruuuuuuumble!” which he wisely trademarked in 1992 – a move that has reportedly earned the American $400m... Like his brother Jake (yes, we’ll get to him), the American started off as a YouTuber before venturing into combat sports. The older Paul brother, 28, began boxing in 2018 and later signed with WWE, where he has prospered since 2022. Outside of various rings, Paul has also seen success with his energy drink Prime and with his Impaulsive podcast. The UFC’s Vice-President of Talent Relations, Maynard is a chief matchmaker in the organisation. For all the UFC’s faults, its ability to produce fan-favourite match-ups is unrivalled, and it deserves credit for that – meaning Maynard does, too. MMA’s greatest fighter ever, in the eyes of many fans. Others hold the American’s multiple failed drug tests against his legacy, as well as incidents like a hit-and-run in 2015. Jones, 36, took a three-year break from MMA between 2020 and 2023, returning in March to easily win the UFC heavyweight title after spending the rest of his career as a light-heavyweight – and as a multiple-time champion in that division, no less. “Tank” is one of the most fearsome punchers in boxing, but that asset has ironically seen some top-level fights elude the American. He finally got his first big-name opponent in April, when he stopped Ryan Garcia emphatically, but now he must press on in securing bouts with the likes of Devin Haney and Teofimo Lopez. A long-reigning middleweight champion in the UFC, and one of the first superstars to emerge in MMA after McGregor’s peak. The Nigerian-born New Zealander, 34, recently saw his second UFC title reign come to an end and is taking a brief break from the sport. Whenever he returns, however, his next bout will likely be one of the most watched of 2024 or 2025, courtesy of the interest he has generated through his enthralling striking. The manager of Ukrainian icons Oleksandr Usyk and Vasiliy Lomachenko, Klimas has been a key player in this generation of boxing, recently and notably playing his part in arranging Usyk’s upcoming clash with Tyson Fury – which is set to be the biggest fight in decades. A pioneer of women’s boxing. In the biggest women’s fight of all time – and one of boxing’s biggest ever, full stop – the Puerto Rican was unlucky to lose a decision against Katie Taylor in 2022. The 35-year-old should be remembered for much more than that bout, however, when all is said and done; the unified featherweight champion is the only woman to have held world titles in more than four divisions. Nowhere near the boxer that his half-brother Tyson is, but Tommy has played a smart game. The 24-year-old Briton endeared himself to viewers of the reality television show Love Island before returning to boxing, where he has wisely chosen to fight YouTubers instead of legitimate pros. That is not meant as a slight; Fury is better matched in that sphere and is making much more money than he otherwise would. The UFC’s chief business officer and, according to many, the real mastermind at the UFC – not Dana White. The former lawyer has been tipped to succeed White as UFC president, but that role would require much more interaction with the media and public than Campbell currently engages in. Perhaps the next face of boxing. At just 25 years old, Haney has also reigned as undisputed lightweight champion and moved up to collect another world title at super-lightweight. The American has insisted, however, that he has little interest in becoming undisputed again; the “Dream” is keen on super-fights, likely suggesting that he would be content to make as much money as possible before retiring young. DuBoef is the stepson of Bob Arum (more on him later) and the president of the 91-year-old’s promotion, Top Rank Boxing. As such, DuBoef is Arum’s likeliest successor, meaning his power in the boxing sphere should only grow in years to come. The 62-year-old is the founder and CEO of Endeavor, the parent company of the UFC and now also WWE, following a seismic business deal in 2023. It will be intriguing to see how that deal impacts the landscape of MMA and pro wrestling moving forward. In any case, Emanuel will be looking over that very landscape, and he is also said to have significant influence in Hollywood. The best ever in the boxing ring? According to many, yes. Having retired unbeaten as a pro in 2017, the 46-year-old American has since been on a prolonged victory lap, beating boxers, MMA fighters and YouTubers in various exhibition bouts. One of the standout names from this generation of mixed martial artists, the Cameroonian has repeatedly gambled on himself and won big. After leaving the UFC in January 2023, giving up the company’s heavyweight title in the process, the 37-year-old was criticised for ‘fumbling the bag’. Far from it. Ngannou signed a contract with the PFL, where he will make significantly more money than he did in the UFC. The “Predator” also made his boxing debut in October, dropping and arguably doing enough to beat Tyson Fury – only to come up short on points – in one of the most stupefying moments in combat-sports history. If not the greatest women’s boxer of all time, the most important. The Irishwoman initiated the movement that allowed female fighters to compete at the Olympics, where she won gold in 2012. She has since became a two-weight undisputed champion, collecting the second set of belts recently. The 37-year-old beat Chantelle Cameron in a modern classic in November, avenging the only loss of her pro career in the same Dublin venue where she was beaten in May. The greatest cruiserweight of this generation, Usyk is the only man to have been undisputed champion in that division in the four-belt era. Now, he is on the verge of one of boxing’s most remarkable feats ever, as he prepares to face Tyson Fury and potentially become undisputed at heavyweight. The southpaw, 36, is as tricky as they come, as he demonstrated in back-to-back points wins over Anthony Joshua. Yes, to see his name (and a few of the above entries) before the next man’s may be jolting. Arguably boxing’s pound-for-pound No 1, the unbeaten American stopped Errol Spence Jr in an all-time great performance last summer to become undisputed welterweight champion. The 36-year-old has since been stripped of one of his titles, but he won’t mind, having settled one of modern boxing’s biggest debates by beating the previously undefeated Spence Jr in a fight years in the making. His win over Spence Jr also made him the first male boxer to become undisputed in two divisions in the four-belt era. Like Jake Paul, KSI has made a transition from YouTube into boxing, and while he lacks the dedication and relative skill of his American counterpart, the Briton still attracts a huge viewership and has a wildly dedicated legion of fans. His bout with Tommy Fury, like Paul’s, was one of the most-watched fights of 2023. Unfortunately for the 30-year-old, it went the same way as Paul’s, too. The jiu-jitsu black belt and former TV presenter is not as involved on UFC commentary as he used to be, but his Joe Rogan Experience podcast is one of the most successful in all of sport – in all of podcasting, in fact. And since signing a major deal with Spotify, the 56-year-old has even more money than influence – which is a lot, especially with males between the ages of 18 and 34 in America. Ninety-one years old but still involved at the top end of boxing. Arum’s Top Rank is one of the sport’s biggest players, especially due to its broadcast deal with ESPN. In recent years, Arum’s greatest success might have been securing Tyson Fury’s signature to make Top Rank the Briton’s US promoter. The American promoter seemingly suffered a blow when US broadcaster Showtime pulled out of boxing recently, but Haymon’s Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) has since signed with Amazon Prime. The 68-year-old previously managed Floyd Mayweather, and PBC counts Terence Crawford, Deontay Wilder, Errol Spence Jr and Manny Pacquaio among its fighters. “If you asked someone on the street to name three people in UK boxing, they’d probably go: ‘Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua, Eddie Hearn.’” Those were the words of... well, Hearn, in our exclusive interview in 2023 – and the rest of this list is somewhat in keeping with that sentiment. Hearn is omnipresent in boxing, popping up on YouTube multiple times a week for interview after interview. As he has said more than once, he knows “how to sell”. Just as Hearn prizes Anthony Joshua, the promoter’s chief rival Warren counts Tyson Fury as his greatest asset. Warren, 71, has been around numerous blocks numerous times, and his recent progress with key players in Saudi Arabia marks a huge success in a vital moment in boxing history. That progress also sees him edge ahead of Hearn here. Eyebrows might raise over this entry, but Paul’s is another name that has massive crossover capabilities. Again, many will watch simply in hopes that the American, 26, will lose, but the YouTuber’s boxing career survived his first defeat – against Tommy Fury in February – and he is planning to venture into MMA next. He has also been an advocate for greater fighter pay, to his credit, and holds boxing wins over MMA stars like Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley. Even two-and-a-half years on from his last fight – and four years on from his last win – the former UFC champion commands attention like few others. When the Irishman competes, the fighting world stops, and even the average person on the street tends to be aware. Adulation for McGregor, 35, has worn off in his home country in recent years after his series of run-ins with the law, but he has never needed love to thrive; perhaps the hate is just as effective. There was a concerted effort to make Joshua the heavyweight of this generation, before Fury naturally eclipsed his compatriot for various reasons, including Joshua’s trio of losses over the last four years. Even so, much of the British public still harbours great respect for the 34-year-old, who won Olympic gold in London and went on to provide fans with many fun nights courtesy of his knockouts during his come-up. “AJ” is one of the biggest ‘brands’ in sports, and he isn’t done yet in the ring. For a while, arguments raged over whether the unbeaten Briton might be the greatest heavyweight ever. While that status seems to have eluded him, given his lack of big-name opponents in comparison to champions gone by, the consensus is that the 35-year-old is the best heavyweight of his generation. Before becoming WBC champion, Fury held the other belts at once, and he will bid to regain them and become undisputed champion – the first in 24 years – when he faces Oleksandr Usyk in February. The “Gypsy King” demonstrated his influence by delaying that fight until he could have it almost entirely on his terms. While the Mexican is no longer boxing’s pound-for-pound No 1, he is still an elite fighter, a rare pay-per-view draw, an idol in his home country, and the face of boxing worldwide – and he is still just 33 years old. He has flitted between weight classes while taking on all comers, and he continues to reign as undisputed super-middleweight champion. Mixed martial arts is one of the fastest-growing sports in the world, and the UFC is MMA’s undisputed leader. UFC president Dana White may not in fact be the undisputed leader of the promotion (as previous entries on this list have hinted), but he is its figurehead and is more famous than many UFC fighters. The outspoken American, 54, has a remarkable sway over fans’ opinions and a firm control over fighters’ careers. If you don’t recognise Al-Sheikh’s name (sometimes written Alalshikh) at once, the words “His Excellency” may ring a bell, as that is how all of boxing’s kingmakers refer to the Saudi adviser, who might have usurped those very kingmakers at lightning speed in a matter of months. Al-Sheikh, who is also Chairman of General Authority for Entertainment in the Gulf state, is the figure behind the miraculous matchmaking in boxing recently – including Tyson Fury vs Francis Ngannou and the Day of Reckoning event featuring Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder. Right now, even the biggest promoters in the sport seem to be bowing to the 42-year-old’s demands; Saudi Arabia’s immense funds are enabling all of this impressive matchmaking, but Al-Sheikh is the mind that is directing the money.",https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing-ufc-rankings-fighters-promoters-b2470814.html,https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/12/29/15/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200,2024-01-01 12:49:28,Alex Pattle,['Alex Pattle'],en,gb,0.318
175567431,"BJP enters 2024 with a skip in its step, eye on South, building on its positives","No other party or combination in the recent history of India has stepped into an election year with such confidence like the BJP does in 2024. Exuberant with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's still intact popularity and upbeat with the recent electoral victories, the party is sure of its win in 2024. “Only the number matters,” party leaders insist, especially if the BJP can better last year's result. However, like party president J P Nadda says, the BJP does not take any election lightly. At the public meeting after inaugurating the new Maharishi Valmiki Airport in Ayodhya last week, the PM described this as “the joint strength of vikas (development) and virasat (heritage)”. In the words of the BJP, “impatient to see India grow”, in his next term, Modi would focus on making up for lost time. “His second term was marked by the Covid pandemic, China aggression and Russia-Ukraine war, all three factors that slowed down the targeted economic growth,” says a Union Minister, adding that the government hopes to now cash in on the prevalent anti-China sentiment globally. Modi's invocation of “virasat (heritage)” is a continuation of this, BJP leaders say, as “India's cultural history, democratic history, and values and the culture of inclusion” cast it in a favourable light as compared to China, and more in tune with Western sentiments. Apart from China, the next term is likely to see India take a more aggressive stand against Pakistan, with the revocation of Article 370 now getting the formal seal of approval of the Supreme Court and with the neighbouring country caught up in its own inner turmoil. With most of the boxes of its key ideological project ticked, Modi is expected to move fast on the remaining ones, including a uniform civil code and the row over the birthplace of Lord Krishna in Mathura. BJP leaders admit that the party's biggest challenge would be job creation, if it wants to take advantage of the country's young demography – even compared to China, India's average age is 10 years younger. The skilling initiative to ready people for all levels of jobs has not been very successful. Then there is the BJP's thwarted ambition to conquer the South. While this year's Assembly poll loss in Karnataka was another blow, the BJP has already started making amends in the state that gave it 25 of its 28 seats in 2019. One of the big moves was to tie up with the JD(S), to consolidate the Vokkaliga vote, while accepting veteran B S Yeddyurapa's preeminence in the Karnataka unit to secure Lingayat support. And, if the Telangana polls were a disappointment, BJP sources say, the party is getting positive feedback from Tamil Nadu and emerging as the most preferred alternative to the ruling DMK. Party leaders claim the 2024 Lok Sabha results in Tamil Nadu would be a surprise, given Modi's “rising acceptance” in a state whose politics has long drawn sustenance from anti-North India sentiments. While they are officially no longer allies, the BJP has channels open with the AIADMK, and this could further bolster the BJP kitty. In Andhra Pradesh too, the BJP is fishing for allies to get the Lok Sabha numbers. Organisationally, the BJP has already made it clear that large-scale changes are on the cards. In all the three states it won recently, the party went in for surprise names as chief minister candidates – dislodging satraps - and proceeded to fill the caste gaps with the composition of the ministries. “In order to make the party stronger, Modiji will be bringing in more youngsters and fresh faces to the front,” a leader says. Sources said one measure the current leadership may take to keep the door revolving is limiting the terms of a party CM or chief to two terms. Even the Union ministers who have completed two terms could be offered different roles post 2024 Lok Sabha elections. “All the seniors will have to work hard as both the government and the party will be more demanding,” says a leader.",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bjp-2024-lok-sabha-elections-9090611/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/road-to-2024-bjp.jpg,2024-01-01 12:49:47,"Liz Mathew, PM Modi","['Liz Mathew', 'PM Modi']",en,in,-0.055

The PDP’s Kanglung_Samkhar_Udzorong’s candidate, Norbu Wangchuk, complained to the District Election Dispute Settlement Body that the Bhutan Tendrel Party President, Pema Chewang, who is also the party’s Kanglung_Samkhar_Udzorong candidate donated Nu 10,000 for a marathon competition during the 116th National Day Celebrations. According to the District Election Dispute Settlement Body’s decision, Norbu Wangchuk alleged that the donation was in contravention of the Election Act and other regulations. The decision also states that BTP’s Pema Chewang refuted the allegation saying he did not give the donation despite getting a request for one during a meeting with Kanglung business people. Furthermore, the decision stated that Pema Chewang deemed the complaint was put up to defame him and the party, and requested the body to fine Norbu Wangchuk for the same. According to the decision, the PDP candidate could not produce evidence and witness to back up the claim of donation and that without verifying claims made by a few individuals he had alleged others, which is in violation of section 294 of the Election Act and the Rules on Election Conduct 2022. PDP’s Norbu Wangchuk was fined Nu 37,500. Similarly, a supporter of the People’s Democratic Party, Kinzang Tobgay, was fined Nu 15,000 for spreading word about the donation without verifying the claims. The business owner, Rinchen Peldon, who sought donation from the BTP president was also fined Nu 15,000. The District Election Dispute Settlement Body’s decision states that such act is not allowed during the election period. She had also organised the marathon without permission from the Election Commission of Bhutan.

175566999,Morocco law reform offers hope for women’s rights,"Two decades after a landmark but limited revision of Morocco’s family law marked a breakthrough for women, activists hope new reforms will defy Islamist objections and provide greater equality. The reform of the legal code was ordered directly by King Mohammed VI, who is expected to have the final say in any disputes over the new law. A committee tasked with drafting the changes was formed in September and includes the justice minister as well as judicial and religious figures. By the end of November, the committee had already received proposals from more than 1,000 civil organisations, as well as political parties and official institutions. ‘Devil has returned’: Divorced Afghan women forced back to abusive ex-husbands Women’s rights advocates in the North African country have given a hopeful welcome to the plans. Latifa Bouchoua, a member of the Federation of Women’s Rights Leagues (FLDF), said she wanted “a deeper reform (than the last) adapted to the aspirations of new generations who believe in rights and freedoms”. Activists are demanding equality in inheritance, child custody, and a total ban on child marriage – none of which they say are guaranteed under the current family code. The most recent reform took place in 2004 and was heralded as a breakthrough at the time. However, campaigners say the changes still failed to provide women with their full rights. That code gave women joint responsibility for their families, which had previously been granted only to men, and imposed restrictions on unilateral divorce by men, polygamy and underage marriage. However, the reforms fell short of preventing “injustice, discrimination, and legal violence, whether in the text or in its application”, said Samira Muheya, president of the FLDF. In the summer of 2022, King Mohammed said in a speech Morocco needed to “address the deficiencies and negative aspects noted from experience” of the family code. Under current legislation, women are entitled only to half of what men inherit, in line with strict interpretations of the Koran. Polygamy remains legal, although it requires men to have the written consent of their first wife. Only 0.3 per cent of marriages across Morocco in 2022 were polygamous, according to officials. In a divorce, men receive custody of their children by default, while those mothers who do gain custody of their children lose it immediately if they remarry. The key demand made by activists is an end to child marriage. While the legal age for marriage was raised from 15 to 18 in 2004, the authorities continue to issue exemptions for underage girls to marry. A study by the public prosecutor’s office found that 85 per cent of all requests to marry an underage girl submitted between 2011 and 2018 were approved. At COP28, activists urge leaders to address impact of climate change on women Atifa Timjerdine, vice-president of the Democratic Association of Moroccan Women, said the issue “embodies … the discrimination of the law and raises great concerns”. Supporters of women’s rights said gender inequality in Morocco covered much more than family issues alone. Writer Ahmed Assid said the forthcoming reform should go beyond household rules and aim to “change the patriarchal system” as a whole, which he said was “responsible, for example, for widespread unemployment among women, even as girls represent around two thirds of baccalaureate winners each year”. Nearly 35 per cent of women with a university degree are unemployed in Morocco, compared with 20.8 per cent among men, according to official figures. Nevertheless, there has been vocal opposition to the idea of liberal reforms, especially from religious groups. The calls for equality and banning underage marriage and polygamy drew strong objections from within the country’s Islamist organisations, which maintain that such practices are drawn from a traditionalist interpretation of Islamic texts. Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane, an Islamist group that is officially banned but to which the authorities turn a blind eye, insists on “the supremacy of the Islamic reference system” and rejects “any proposal that contradicts it”. The Islamist Justice and Development Party said it would only accept amendments to the law that fitted within “the Islamic framework”. The FLDF’s Muheya insisted that campaigners’ demands were compatible with an “enlightened” interpretation of Islamic texts, and pointed to the principle of equality enshrined in Morocco’s 2011 constitution.",https://www.scmp.com/news/world/africa/article/3246906/morocco-law-reform-offers-hope-womens-rights,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/01/142484fc-1b6a-45f0-b740-eb2de6c50e95_1a67859d.jpg,2024-01-01 12:57:21,"Agence France-Presse, King Mohammed VI","['Agence France-Presse', 'King Mohammed VI']",en,cn,0.201
175565861,PSLV-C58 XPoSat: India launches satellite to study black holes from Sriharikota,"The Indian Space Research Organisation successfully launched India’s first X-Ray Polarimeter Satellite on Monday, or XPoSat, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The satellite is designed to provide information about celestial objects such as black holes. It was carried into space by a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket. According to the ISRO, the PSLV-C58 rocket successfully launched payload XPoSat into Low Earth Orbit on its 60th flight. On January 1, the PSLV-C58 rocket took off at 9.10 a.m. from this spaceport’s first launch pad, which is situated around 135 kilometres east of Chennai. It is the first specifically designed ISRO scientific satellite to conduct studies on polarisation measurements of X-ray radiation from astronomical sources from space. Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) studied supernova explosion remnants, black hole particle streams, and other cosmic occurrences in December 2021 with the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer mission. Although India has established space-based X-ray astronomy with an emphasis on imaging and time domain investigations, the space agency stated that Monday’s mission represents a significant contribution to the scientific community. In order to conduct long-term spectral and temporal investigations of cosmic X-ray sources, the PSLV-C58 mission aims to measure the polarisation of X-rays in the energy band 8-30 keV emitted by about 50 possible cosmic sources. When analysing the radiation process and geometry of astronomical sources, X-ray polarisation is an essential diagnostic tool. POLIX (Polarimeter Instrument in X-Rays), developed by the Raman Research Institute to determine polarimetry parameters, and XSPECT (X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing), constructed by the U R Rao Satellite Centre, Bengaluru, are the main payloads of XPoSat. With the launch of its first X-Ray Polarimeter satellite, the ISRO ushered in the new year. Following the success of the Gaganyaan Test Vehicle D1 mission in October, the launch occurred. India achieved unprecedented achievement in 2023 with the gentle landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the Moon’s south pole and the launch of Aditya-L1, the country’s first solar mission. Following the momentous August 23 landing of Vikram Lander on the Moon, the Pragyan rover was sent out to explore the lunar south pole, which had not before been explored. India’s current objectives include the Gaganyaan Mission, establishing Bharatiya Antariksha Station by 2035, and sending the country’s first person to the moon by 2040.",https://apnlive.com/india-news/mumbai-drunk-driving/,https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/apnlive/uploads/2024/01/01172454/images-97-1000x600.webp,2024-01-01 12:57:22,APN Live,['APN Live'],en,in,-0.166
175564795,1 Lakh People Participate In Bhaderwah Winter Festival In J&#038;K&#8217;s Doda,"Jammu, Jan 1: More than one lakh people visited the five-day Bhaderwah winter festival in Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district that concluded on Sunday with a celebration to usher in the new year. The festival is a symbol of the cultural splendour and winter charm of the Chenab Valley and aims at promoting the local culture and traditions, and showcase the tourism potential of Bhaderwah, officials said. The tourism department is “committed to tap the untapped tourism potential of Bhaderwah and other lesser known tourist destinations” of Jammu and Kashmir, Tourism Secretary Abid Rashid said. “The aim of holding such kinds of festivals is to promote local culture, traditions, and to tap the tourism potential” of areas bestowed with natural scenic and serene surroundings, he said. Rashid said the department is also promoting homestays to meet the shortage of tourism infrastructure and to create livelihood for locals. The festival was organised by the Directorate of Tourism, Jammu, in collaboration with the Doda district administration, the Academy of Art, Culture and Language and the Bhaderwah Development Authority. To conclude the festival, there was a performance by Punjabi singer Kaka and a display of fireworks. Over the five days, the Bhaderwah Fort was illuminated and it hosted several cultural performances. Films such as ‘Sam Bahadur’, ‘Tiger-3′ and ’12th Fail’ were screened during the festival. “The festival not only showcased the natural beauty and cultural heritage of Bhaderwah but also marked its emergence as a dynamic hub of tourism in the Chenab Valley, blending tradition with modernity,” Doda Deputy Commissioner S Harvinder Singh said. He expressed keen interest in encouraging the tourism sector in the district to create livelihood opportunities and to give the district its due share on the tourism map of the country. “All measures will be taken to improve the tourism infrastructure of the district,” Singh said. The deputy commissioner said that in view of the great potential of the district in the tourism sector, some private stakeholders have already pitched in, and world-class hotels and some five-star facilities are being established. The administration is committed to work towards having tourism activities in the district throughout the year, he said. Joint Director Tourism Sunaina Mehta said Bhaderwah has been earmarked as a wedding destination and a site for ‘Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE)’ tourism. She said last year, over five lakh tourists visited Bhaderwah.

175564763,"24 things we think will happen in 2024: politics, movies, sports, and tech","It was either the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr or Hall of Fame New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra (or, quite possibly, neither of them) who coined the phrase: “Predictions are hard to make, especially about the future.” Nonetheless, for the fifth year in a row, the staff of Future Perfect will venture its best estimations of what major news events will or won’t take place in 2024. Will Donald Trump return to the White House? Will OpenAI release ChatGPT-5? Will antibiotic sales for farmed animals increase? Will inflation continue to moderate? Will Oppenheimer win Best Picture? (It would have Bohr’s vote, if he were a member of the Academy and if he were alive.) But we don’t just make blind predictions. In keeping with the best practices of forecasters, we attach probabilities to each of our predictions. Pay attention to the probabilities! 80 percent, or even 90 percent, does not mean we are certain an event will definitely happen. (If we were, we would say 100 percent.) Rather, it means that if we made five predictions or 10 predictions, we’d expect four or nine of them to come true, respectively. And as we have every year, we’ll be keeping track of how we do in 2024 and letting you know our performance. (You can check out how we did in 2023 here.) —Bryan Walsh Predicting a presidential race a year out is tough. As political scientists Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien have noted, “polls from the beginning of the election year have virtually no predictive power” when it comes to calling presidential races. People still respond to the state of the economy the year the election is held and the new facts they learn about the candidates as campaigns progress. A better approach than using polling is to reference some of the forecasting models political scientists have developed for predicting elections in advance. But many of these rely on data that’s only available mid-year, like presidential approval ratings or economic growth in the first half of the year. The one exception is a model from political scientist Jay DeSart, which does state-by-state predictions of outcomes based on prior voting habits of the state and the national polling average in October of the year prior to the election. I plugged October 2023’s head-to-head Biden/Trump polls into the model and found that it predicts a healthy Trump victory (297 electoral votes to 241), with the median forecast seeing Biden lose Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin but hang on to Michigan. But it’s a narrow advantage. The polls I relied on showed an average Trump lead of 0.2 points. A swing of less than 2 points in the polls would lead to a prediction of a Biden victory. So while I think the public’s lackluster mood toward the economy and Biden’s relative unpopularity put him at a disadvantage going into 2024, it’ll be a nail-biter for sure. This, of course, assumes Trump will be on the ballot, and the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling disqualifying him puts that in some doubt. But I don’t think much doubt; as Andrew Prokop explained for Vox, the likely outcome here is that the Supreme Court rules on whether Trump’s participation in the January 6, 2021, insurrection disqualifies him from the ballot, and I cannot envision the Court ruling against Trump, both because of its partisan leanings and out of fear of Trump supporter backlash delegitimizing the Court. —Dylan Matthews The 2024 Senate map is absolutely brutal for Democrats. They are defending 23 seats to only 11 held by Republicans, and only two of the latter (in Florida and Texas) are remotely competitive. Democrats don’t stand much of a chance of regaining the seats they lost six years ago in deep-red Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota, and challenging Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) will be expensive and difficult. Florida is trending Republican, and Texas hasn’t elected a Democrat to statewide office in three decades. Democrats, by contrast, are without a doubt losing a seat (the one Joe Manchin is vacating in West Virginia), and the Cook Political Report lists three others as tossups: the reelection bids of Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and the three-way race between independent Krysten Sinema, Democrat Ruben Gallego, and an as yet undetermined Republican in Arizona. Tester and Brown are both in states that Trump won in 2020 by wide margins, and both won very narrowly six years ago. Democrats have a 51-49 majority right now, and the loss of West Virginia will narrow that to 50-50. So for Republicans to regain control, they either need to win the presidency (letting Donald Trump’s vice president break the 50-50 tie) or beat either Tester, Brown, or Gallego/Sinema. That’s before considering the several seats where Democrats are narrowly favored (in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Michigan) but could still be vulnerable. Simply put: There are many, many ways for Republicans to retake the Senate. Everything has to go right simultaneously for Democrats to keep it. That makes for high odds of Republican capture. —DM Republicans currently hold a margin in the House nearly as razor-thin as the Democrats’ lead in the Senate. After George Santos’s expulsion in December, Republicans held 221 seats, just three above the bare minimum needed for a majority. If they lose five seats in November (or four and also lose Santos’s seat in the special election on February 13), they’re toast. There are a few reasons to think Republicans will do slightly worse than they did in 2022, just enough to lose the House. Among the most important is a recent court ruling in New York ordering a redistricting of the state’s House seats, which most observers think will favor Democrats. That offsets an effort in North Carolina to gerrymander in favor of Republicans. More importantly, House and presidential voting are becoming increasingly correlated, and that’s good news for Democrats. The 2022 midterms saw 18 Republicans elected from Biden-won districts, and only five Democrats elected in Trump-won districts. Redistricting scrambles those numbers somewhat (and Santos, one of the 18, is gone), but that suggests that Democrats have more obvious pickup opportunities than Republicans do in 2024. There’s still an easy-to-imagine world where Republicans hold the House, especially if Trump wins the presidential race and if he pulls out a popular vote victory this time. But Democrats have a modest leg up at this point. —DM In 2022, I predicted that inflation (measured by the Fed’s preferred metric) would stay below 3 percent; I was very wrong, as prices continued to rise at rates we hadn’t seen in decades. In 2023, I predicted inflation would stay above 3 percent; I was right, but inflation was falling rapidly by the end of the year. It looks like 2024 will actually enjoy the kind of low inflation I projected two years ago. Prices will probably rise moderately, and interest rates will remain pretty high, but the big spikes we saw a while back won’t return. The Federal Reserve Board’s range of estimates for the year is between 2.3 and 3 percent, with the median at 2.4 percent. The Survey of Professional Forecasters, which pulls together estimates from economists at banks and other private-sector entities, finds that on average they put 23.2 percent probability on prices rising by more than 3 percent between the fourth quarter of 2023 and that of 2024. I’m a little less confident than them, partly because the 2022 experience made me reduce my overall confidence in our collective ability to forecast price dynamics this far in advance. More to the point, the specific forces that drove prices high in 2022, like a semiconductor shortage and supply chain disruptions from Covid and the Ukraine war, do not seem likely to repeat next year. Then again, I didn’t see the Ukraine war coming, and it’s possible another curveball like that (maybe a Chinese incursion into Taiwan?) could send prices soaring. —DM Every year since the Covid-19 pandemic, the US has faced a dismal surge in car crash deaths. In 2021, for the first time since 2007, car fatalities surpassed 40,000, likely due to how Covid permanently altered America’s driving routines, among other factors. The most recent full year figures available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), from 2022, show that close to 43,000 Americans were killed by cars that year, and an early estimate for the first nine months of 2023 (January through September) shows more than 30,000 deaths over that period. I’d be surprised if 2023 traffic patterns differed enough from 2022 to bring us back to the pre-pandemic baseline (and the preliminary data is consistent with that hunch), so I predict that when NHTSA releases total 2023 car death figures, they’ll easily remain above 40,000. —Marina Bolotnikova Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel was an unprecedented calamity for the country, and many analysts think it will finally be the end of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Though he’s tried to place the blame elsewhere for the failure to protect Israelis, the people aren’t buying it: Polls keep showing that voters want him out — by a wide margin. In fact, the outrage being directed against him is so intense that some will find it weird that I’m only giving it 75 percent odds that he’ll be unseated in 2024. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned from my years living in and reporting on Israel, it’s that you should never underestimate Bibi’s canny campaigning and his ability to rise from the political ashes. We’ve seen it happen before. It is conceivable that he manages to cling to power for yet another term. Still, I think if ever there was a time when he could be pushed out, it’s now. —Sigal Samuel Future Perfect has repeatedly predicted that the coming year will be warmer than the previous one, giving it 80 percent odds. As my colleague Kelsey Piper has noted, “This is based on looking at the last 25 years of atmospheric temperature data: On average, in four out of five years, this prediction would be right.” With the continued burning of fossil fuels that cause climate change, it should come as no surprise that 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded. And 2024 will probably be even hotter, in part because of El Niño, the warm phase of the Pacific Ocean’s temperature pattern. In fact, experts predict that 2024 may be the first year that the average global surface temperature tops 1.5 degrees Celsius above what it was in the pre-industrial period. —SS Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could reasonably claim to be the most popular democratically elected leader in the world. According to Morning Consult’s weekly approval ratings of more than 20 democratic leaders, Modi’s net approval was a sky-high +60 among Indian voters as of late November, twice as high as the next most popular leader. And while other politicians around the world have seen their fortunes ebb and flow, Modi’s popularity has barely changed since the polls first became available in August 2019. That personal popularity has translated to electoral wins, most recently in state elections in December, where Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) achieved a sweeping victory in three heavily populated northern states. Beginning in April, hundreds of millions of Indian voters will go to the polls to pick their next government in the world’s largest election. Could Modi, who has been in power since 2014, lose? It’s possible — more than 20 opposition parties, including the BJP’s main opponent the Congress Party, formed the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance in July in an effort to present a unified opposition. But this election is easier to call than just about any other in 2024. I would be shocked if Modi doesn’t stay in power — and tighten his grip on it. In fact, the real question isn’t so much who will win the 2024 Indian elections, but whether we’ll see free and fair ones in the future. As my colleague Zack Beauchamp wrote in June, Modi has “systematically taken a hammer to the core institutions of Indian democracy.” From manipulating judges to controlling the press to undermining the machinery of elections, Modi is pushing the boundaries on how authoritarian a leader can become while still being “democratically elected.” Add in the allegations that Indian intelligence ordered the assassination of a Canadian citizen in Canada, and tried to do the same in the US, and 2024 is set to be a watershed year for India and its democracy — whatever the outcome of the spring’s election. —BW If the US election in 2024 will be close, our neighbor to the south will probably see a resounding landslide. Current polling suggests the overwhelming favorite is Claudia Sheinbaum, an engineering professor and climate researcher who until recently served as mayor of Mexico City. She is the nominee of the left-wing Morena party and a longtime ally of the party’s founder and leading figure, incumbent President Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador. AMLO, as he is known by the Mexican public, remains wildly popular, which is especially notable at a time when Covid-19 and inflation have cratered the popularity of many incumbent governments. Being his preferred successor gives Sheinbaum an incredible edge. She’s not the intensely charismatic firebrand that her mentor is, but the fact that she remains roughly 20 points ahead of her nearest rival when that rival has the support of all three major opposition parties — parties that have historically fought each other tooth and nail but united to take down AMLO and Morena — makes me think she has this in the bag. —DM As of this writing, Russia controls the red portions of Ukraine’s territory: In 2014, Russia seized Crimea and used separatist militias to establish two puppet regimes in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. When it began a full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022, it was able to seize the land between these two areas, establishing a “land bridge” that allowed it to run supplies between its two major footholds in Ukraine. Russia is also linked to Crimea by the Kerch Bridge and can use that to supply troops in Crimea as well, but Ukraine understandably keeps blowing that bridge up. Breaking the “land bridge,” then, has become a major goal of the Ukrainian military. If they can lead an offensive through the middle of Russian-held territory, they can split the Russian zone in two, and perhaps even enable a blockade of Crimea that could force the peninsula to yield. That would then free up resources to regain control of Russian-occupied land to the east. It’s a good goal, but to date, Ukraine has struggled to achieve it. The much anticipated 2023 offensive by Ukrainian forces was mostly a bust, failing to change the frontlines appreciably. The proliferation of drones providing reconnaissance for both sides has made it more challenging to launch surprise attacks, effectively providing an advantage to the defending side. That’s good for retaining Ukrainian control over the majority of its territory, but bad for retaking land Russia has claimed. We’re not at a point of total battlefield surveillance, though, and more modest changes in the frontlines are possible. It’s also possible that one or the other side develops effective enough signal-jamming approaches that they can deny their enemy the ability to use drones, which could enable rapid movement. But I think the existing dynamics of the war make a severing of the land bridge unlikely in the next year. —DM After publishing some promising study results, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) recently filed for FDA approval of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. Now the two questions are: Will the FDA grant its approval, and if so, will it do so by the end of 2024? For my prediction to come true, we need a “yes” to both. I am pretty confident MDMA will get the green light because in addition to the strong study results (and MAPS and the FDA agreed in advance on the study design), there is now robust public support for trying innovative methods to help people with mental health issues. A 2022 letter from the Health and Human Services Department disclosed that President Biden’s administration anticipates regulators will approve MDMA for PTSD and psilocybin for depression within the next two years. But the FDA is, um, not exactly known for speed. If it views the MAPS filing as complete, it will aim to render a decision in six to 10 months. But because this is a psychedelic drug we’re talking about, we may see extra risk evaluations, which could drag out the timeline. So although I think approval is likely in late 2024, I won’t give this prediction more than 85 percent odds. —SS A company that fires its CEO, promotes an interim CEO, then hires a new CEO, then experiences a total company rebellion, then brings back the original CEO, all within a week, is a company that is inherently hard to predict. And that’s especially true given that divisions over AI safety and the rate at which OpenAI was commercializing its products played at least some role in that internal division. It might make sense for OpenAI to take a beat and get its stuff together before unleashing the next full version of ChatGPT upon the world. But the former and future OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is nothing if not ambitious, and we know the company has been working on ChatGPT-5. (For the purposes of this prediction, OpenAI will need to release a product called “ChatGPT-5” — no “ChatGPT-4.5 Turbo” or whatever.) If anything, 75 percent might be a bit low. The good people at Metaculus currently have September 2024 as their median forecast for when ChatGPT-5 will be released. My hesitancy largely stems from the possibility that in the aftermath of the management implosion, OpenAI might take the opportunity to be more deliberate with its commercial rollouts. That said, given the increasing competition in the large language model arena — and the need to generate revenue to cover the crippling cost of all that computing — OpenAI will probably continue its evolution into an actual tech company and just keep shipping. —BW Last year, I predicted that Starship, SpaceX’s newest and biggest rocket system, would reach orbit. It did not, but its two test flights in 2023 nonetheless registered some progress, with the second passing through the Kármán line and becoming the most powerful vehicle ever to reach outer space. The orbit prediction was flawed not just because it was wrong, but because it was an ill-chosen threshold on my part. Even if the test flights SpaceX conducted had totally succeeded by the company’s own standards, the craft would not have entered orbit or made it a full rotation around the Earth. A more meaningful standard would be a test where neither the first nor second stage of the rocket is lost due to an explosion or “unscheduled rapid disassembly,” to use the term SpaceX employed to describe the fate of the second stage during the second test flight this year. Ultimately, the goal is for Starship to be fully reusable and each part of it recoverable for future launches. That said, Elon Musk has indicated that recovery is a secondary priority to getting the system to a point where it can successfully launch satellites. My prediction will be met even if test flights do not result in the first or second stages being recovered in reusable form, or even fully intact. They can break apart on contact with the water. But they can’t explode due to the rocket’s flight termination system or some error during the flight like out-of-control ignition of fuel. Everything has to go as planned while the rockets are going up, even if they aren’t recognizable once they make it back down. —DM It has been over four years since Elon Musk unveiled the design of the Tesla Cybertruck, a disastrous event that culminated in lead designer Franz von Holzhausen attempting to show off how tough the vehicle’s “armor glass” windows were and smashing them in the process. This past November, Tesla finally unveiled the “finalized” model of the truck to auto journalists and other observers, and it’s as ridiculous as promised. It’s still boxy, still looks like a poorly rendered car from a Nintendo 64 game, and it still has a single, nearly 4-foot-long “monowiper” to clean the windshield. (Will the wiper snap in half at the first sight of inclement weather? TBD!) The first trucks were delivered to consumers on November 30. But knowing Tesla and Musk, and knowing that this truck was first promised to be available in 2021, that seems more like a publicity stunt than the beginning of the vehicle’s general availability. I have serious doubts about the likelihood of the model ramping up production enough to fill more than a small fraction of existing orders. The company is already saying that the base model will not be available until 2025, and I expect delays on the higher-end all-wheel-drive models currently being promised for 2024. I’m not too confident in this prediction; Tesla has more experience producing electric vehicles than any other company on earth, and that makes me think there’s a real chance they can figure out how to make this thing at scale. But they also have a well-earned reputation for overpromising and underdelivering, which I think is the likely outcome for the Cybertruck. —DM As of this writing, there are two US cities where average people can download an app from the Alphabet-owned firm Waymo and get a ride from a self-driving taxi that doesn’t even have a human driver in it as backup: San Francisco and Phoenix. Waymo, formerly the self-driving division of Google, has long been a leader in this space, and has shot forward after the General Motors-owned Cruise was banned from SF following an incident in which a pedestrian was trapped under one of its vehicles. Cruise then announced it was suspending all US operations to “earn public trust,” and its CEO quit in due course. Cruise’s travails mean Waymo is now the uncontested king of self-driving in the US, at least for the moment. “If Waymo can perfect its technology, it could have time to establish market dominance,” my former Vox colleague Timothy Lee writes, who, along with the Verge’s Andrew Hawkins, is one of the people I trust most on self-driving cars. Establishing market dominance requires expansion, and Waymo seems set to expand in 2024. It has established customer waitlists in Austin and Los Angeles, and offered a brief “tour” in the latter city this year where ordinary customers could try it. I’m predicting that at least one new city — probably Austin or Los Angeles, but anything’s possible I suppose — will reach the status of San Francisco and Phoenix in 2024, where ordinary people can download the Waymo One app and order a ride. Because of high demand, the company still rations out invite codes needed to use the app, but anecdotally those are pretty easy to get (you can DM Waymo on Twitter/X and usually get one). I assume they’ll do the same in new cities. But I’m guessing that several thousand more people are going to be using robotaxis routinely in 2024 than in 2023. —DM Almost 70 percent of medically important antibiotics sold in the US go to the livestock sector in an attempt to ward off disease in unsanitary factory farms, giving rise to antibiotic-resistant “superbugs” which in turn make antibiotics less effective for humans. The World Health Organization has gone as far as to call on meat producers to phase out routine antibiotic use in livestock and only administer them when animals get sick. New US Food and Drug Administration rules set in the mid-2010s led to a dramatic drop in antibiotic sales for livestock, but they’ve ticked back up since 2017. I predict that trend will have continued in 2023 (the FDA will release sales data for 2023 at the end of 2024). I could be wrong, given that a lot of antibiotics are fed to cattle and beef production is expected to have fallen almost 5 percent in 2023. The pork industry buys a lot of antibiotics, too, and their production is expected to increase only 1 percent in 2023. Turkey producers make up a small but growing share of antibiotic sales, and production is expected to have increased almost 5 percent in 2023. That should all lead to about a 1 percent overall decrease in antibiotic sales for 2023, but the amount of antibiotics purchased by meat producers doesn’t neatly correspond with production levels. For example, in 2022, the growth in antibiotic sales for beef and pork far outpaced the growth in actual pork and beef production. So, I’m going to predict an increase of at least one percent. —KT Oatly makes, in my opinion, the tastiest plant-based milk on the market. A lot of people agree, and the company took the dairy alternative sector by storm in the late 2010s. The fervor drove the company to go public in May 2021 with a stock price debut of $17 per share, which peaked at almost $29 that summer. Since then, it’s been in free fall. It’s now just a little over $1 per share, and earlier this year, it went under 50 cents per share. The company has been plagued by manufacturing shortages and inefficiencies, and a wave of imitators. Oatly pretty much created oat milk in the 1990s, but once it started to become popular, every company that was making plant milk from soy, almonds, and other ingredients began making milk from oats, too. In other words, it’s partly a victim of its own success. In its quarter three financials released in November, it reported just a 2.5 percent revenue increase year over year, with sales shooting up in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, slightly declining in the Americas, and dropping sharply by 31 percent in Asia. It just opened its first production facility in China, which could help it turn things around in the region where it’s arguably poised for the most growth. That said, global plant-based milk sales were still growing last year, and the company has a better product and branding than its competitors. But I’m skeptical it’ll be enough to help the company ramp up its revenue. —KT From the start of 2015 to the end of 2023, the share of US eggs from cage-free chickens leapt from around 6 percent to 39 percent. It was the result of persistent campaigning from animal welfare advocates that stretched back to the early 2000s — primarily lobbying state legislatures, passing statewide ballot measures, and persuading food corporations to change their animal welfare policies. (Disclosure: I worked on the issue on and off from 2012 to 2017 at animal welfare nonprofits prior to joining Vox.) The share of hens raised cage-free has grown by about 5 percent each year since 2019, but I’m going to predict we’ll see a slightly bigger percentage growth — 6 percent — in 2023 for two reasons. The first is that three state laws requiring all eggs sold in the state to be cage-free come into effect on January 1, 2024, in Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. Their populations combined account for around 5 percent of US egg consumption. Even more state laws go into effect at the start of 2025, covering around 7 percent of US egg consumption. However, I’m not predicting a 12 percent increase because some of those states’ egg supply is already cage-free. Plus, some of the ramp-up to these laws may already be reflected in recent data or won’t be reflected in the end of 2024 data. Second, most food corporations that committed to going cage-free set a 2025 deadline. Many companies have or will meet it, but many won’t, especially grocers, which sell a big portion of the US egg supply. Two of the biggest — Kroger and Walmart — have already backed away from their 2025 deadlines. But speaking from experience, nothing spurs action better than a deadline, so we may see companies inch closer to their goal than they did in previous years. The switch from a cage farm to a cage-free farm represents just a marginal improvement for a hen’s life, but it’s remarkable that a tiny, poorly funded movement has been able to change a fundamental practice of a massive industry. I’ll bet that in 2024, the rate of change will be a little faster than in recent years. —KT 2022 was the worst year ever for avian flu in the US. The outbreak tore through giant chicken and turkey factory farms throughout the country, resulting in the mass extermination (using, it’s worth emphasizing, the cruelest kill method imaginable) of more than 57 million birds. Last year, Future Perfect predicted that 2023 bird flu deaths would again exceed 50 million, which didn’t quite come true. As of this writing (December 21), only about 19 million poultry birds have been culled in 2023, bringing the total from the bird flu outbreak that began in 2022 to about 77 million. Nearly all of those 2023 killings took place in the last couple months of the year, which means that we’re currently in a big resurgence of the disease (consistent with its seasonal transmission pattern). The number of birds culled between October and the end of 2023 was more than double the number from the same period the previous year, which tells me avian flu is heavily ramping up right now rather than slowing down, as it was in late 2022. But the flow of animal diseases can be pretty surprising, so with all that in mind, I predict with medium confidence that by the end of this year, the 2024 death toll from bird flu will exceed 20 million. —MB This past November, animal rights activist Wayne Hsiung was convicted and sentenced to jail time for his role in mass actions at two California factory farms in 2018 and 2019. The group Hsiung co-founded in 2013, Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), has fueled a resurgence of the radical wing of the animal rights movement, with risky tactics including trespassing at factory farms and rescuing animals suffering there. Hsiung’s jail sentence was the first one ever for DxE, and I think there will soon be more. This year, he and two other activists, Eva Hamer and Paul Darwin Picklesimer, will face trial in Madison, Wisconsin, for entering a facility that breeds beagles for animal testing and rescuing three of the dogs in 2017. I think at least one conviction and jail or prison sentence is more likely than any other individual outcome (the others include acquittal, conviction with no jail time, a deadlocked jury, or the case getting dropped or delayed by prosecutors), though my confidence is quite low because jury trials can be very unpredictable. In October 2022, for example, Hsiung and Picklesimer were acquitted for rescuing two piglets from pork giant Smithfield Foods in a historic trial in a very conservative Utah county. Madison (where I live!) is ultra-progressive by comparison, and it’s adorable beagles, rather than food animals, that are at the heart of the case. I’ll be watching the trial closely and will definitely keep readers apprised. —MB If you didn’t cry during the womanhood montage in Barbie set to Billie Eilish’s melancholic crooning, you didn’t do the movies right, I’m afraid. But in all seriousness, the Gen Z icon has a pretty strong track record at the Grammys. She holds seven Grammys, one of which was for her James Bond song, “No Time to Die.” If there’s anything Billie does especially well, it’s an emotional ballad for a movie! It also doesn’t hurt that “What Was I Made For?” was nominated across five categories. I will be shocked if her girl sadness anthem doesn’t get another win under her belt next month. —Izzie Ramirez 2023 was Schiaparelli’s year! Beyoncé’s Renaissance Tour featured this custom moment from the haute couture brand, and who could forget rapper Doja Cat’s controversial, head-to-toe scarlet bedazzled look? Kylie Jenner is already a fan of Schiaparelli, wearing a glittery gold gown earlier this year, and Kim Kardashian wore the brand at the 2023 Met Gala. Given that the gala and accompanying exhibition’s theme for 2024 — “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” — is centered around the sensory qualities and ephemeral nature of a garment prior to being archived, I truly believe one of the Kardashians or Jenner family members will roll up to the steps of the Met adorned in Schiaparelli. Creative director Daniel Roseberry has revitalized the fashion house with edge, a keen sense of humor, and plenty of historical nods to the brand’s founder, Elsa Schiaparelli. There are a lot of motifs to choose from, ranging from the surreal anatomic iconography to the groundbreaking lobster dress. While I don’t quite think the Kardashian-Jenners will repeat wearing an archival piece given the hoopla around Kim in Marilyn Monroe’s dress, Schiaparelli will certainly be up to the artistic and technological challenge of bringing the gala’s theme to life. It’s just a matter of choosing between Kim, Kylie, Kendall, Khloe, Kourtney, or Kris. —IR Did any of the other likely nominees for Best Picture successfully simulate a nuclear explosion on film without the use of CGI? Let’s see … Martin Scorcese’s three-hour and 26-minute 1920s epic Killers of the Flower Moon? Nope. The Holdovers’s grouchy Paul Giamatti in a New England boarding school take on the modern Christmas film? Zero explosions, other than the verbal kind. Very, very weird Emma Stone-starring Poor Things? No, only sex bombs. (And Oppenheimer had those, too.) The other half of Barbenheimer, Greta Gerwig’s “is it a feminist masterpiece or a toy commercial or some kind of postmodern mashup of the two” Barbie? Honestly, I’m not sure — I took my 6-year-old son to the film and he demanded we leave once Kate McKinnon’s Weird Barbie showed up about 20 minutes in. I think he had his first existential crisis. The bottom line? The Academy loves biopics, it loves period pieces, and for some reason, it weirdly loves modern films that feature black-and-white scenes. J. Robert Oppenheimer wasn’t quite the hero the film makes him out to be — read our piece on the “cry baby scientist” — but come Oscar night, Oppie is going home a winner. —BW For those of you who don’t follow baseball — which, given the ratings for the 2023 World Series, is essentially all of you — Shohei Ohtani may be the best baseball player since Babe Ruth. That is not hyperbole. In 2023, Ohtani recorded a WAR stat of 10.1, a full 16 percent higher than the next-best player. (WAR means “wins above replacement,” and it calculates how many more game wins an individual player is worth than a totally average player at the same position. It’s basically the stat to rule all stats for Moneyball heads.) But what’s really amazing is that while Ohtani wasn’t the best hitter or best pitcher by WAR rankings, he was the only player in baseball who did both. He hits baseballs a long way, and he strikes lots of guys out. No one in baseball has done that since … Babe Ruth. Those unique skills earned Ohtani the largest contract in sports history, with the Los Angeles Dodgers paying him $700 million for 10 years. (It also comes with some unique elements, including the fact that Ohtani will actually defer $680 million of that $700 million until after the 10 years of his contract is completed, which apparently is legal?) That sets him up for some sky-high expectations in the 2024 season. Because of an injury last season, Ohtani won’t be able to pitch in 2024, which means he’ll be focused exclusively on hitting. He was already on pace for 51 home runs last year before his injury, which would have put him just behind the major league lead in that category. I think he has an excellent chance to lead the league in homers in 2024 — and without the distraction of pitching, I’d even give him an outside chance to break Barry Bonds (just ever so slightly steroid-tainted) major league record of 70.

175570107,‘It’s a nightmare’: Landlords in a bind as France imposes tough new emissions rules,"Michelle Bassano owns a desirable asset: a top-floor studio apartment she rents out in an almost 200-year-old building in the historic Marais district of central Paris. But she is now thinking of walking away as the issue of trying to meet France’s strict new energy efficiency standards is proving too challenging. “It is a nightmare,” said Bassano. “I’m thinking of just selling.” Bassano’s neighbours in the jointly-owned building refuse to ratify the roughly €100,000 needed to replace and insulate the zinc roof. Adding insulation to the stone facade outside is banned by historical preservation mandates – yet insulating the inside would mean losing precious space in the 25sq m (269sq ft) flat and cutting into its resale value. Landlords across France are grappling with looming restrictions on renting out poorly insulated apartments and homes under strict new rules that phase in gradually from 2023. They aim to incentivise owners to renovate roughly two-thirds of France’s 37 million homes by 2050. President Emmanuel Macron’s government argues that widescale renovations are needed to address a big source of greenhouse gas emissions: buildings account for almost half of French energy consumption and a third of carbon emissions, while two-thirds of that total comes from homes. Experts say his government’s intervention is unique in Europe. The new rules pose a particular problem for apartment buildings and historic homes like many in Paris, along with picturesque villages from Provence to Alsace. Homes in the Marais are doomed to remain in the bottom half of the government’s energy rating system even with renovations, say experts. Critics are already warning of unintended consequences: they say the policy may worsen France’s housing shortage and could even spark social unrest as high inflation also hits households. Jean-Claude Bassien, deputy chief executive of property group Nexity, thinks the government’s approach is the right one but that the timetable is “unrealistic and absurd”. “We will need more time if we want to do this well and avoid a repeat of the gilets jaunes,” he added, referring to protests, named for the yellow jackets worn by demonstrators, that rocked France in 2018 over a proposed carbon tax on petrol. To incentivise renovations, owners are required to get properties rated for energy efficiency, classifying them from A (best) to G (worst), before they can be sold or rented out. The regulations offer both carrot and stick: poorly insulated homes will gradually be excluded from the rental market over the next decade, but public money is available to help pay for insulation, new windows or upgraded heating. Landlords of F- and G-rated homes may no longer raise rents, and as of this year, the worst of the G-rated properties cannot be rented to new tenants. By 2028, 5.2 million homes rated F and G, or 17 per cent of total housing stock, will become ineligible for rental. By 2034, all E and D rated properties will be excluded, amounting to more than half of all homes. Even some in Macron’s camp worry that the approach is too draconian. Finance minister Bruno Le Maire hinted that he supported softening the rules, but was then forced to backpedal. While countries across Europe are trying a range of policies to decarbonise and boost the energy efficiency of homes, none have tried what France is doing, said Boris Cournède, a policy expert at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. “Everyone is looking at the French example, to see how it plays out,” he said. “It’s a good idea on paper even if it’s a bit early to judge the results.” In Germany, the government has taken a different approach, including banning gas boilers – a politically contentious measure – and creating a carbon dioxide tax on home heating. Belgium and Austria have tweaked regulations to facilitate renovations of multi-owner apartment buildings. France has pledged to increase subsidies for home renovations to almost €5 billion from €3.4 billion last year. But a Green party-led Senate report argued much more funding was needed – one estimate puts the requirement closer to €25 billion a year. Accessing the cash available is not always easy, with a long application process and complex rules. Gilles Lambert has applied for about €10,000 in subsidies to renovate a 1980s building he owns with four rental apartments in a leafy Paris suburb. “The application has been a complicated obstacle course,” said the 62-year-old. In the meantime, two of his flats have been banned from the market. Real estate agents and property management companies have warned that the rules may aggravate housing shortages in cities such as Marseille, Bordeaux and Lyon by shrinking the pool of homes to rent. Édouard Philippe, Macron’s former prime minister and now mayor of Le Havre, said excluding low-rated homes would “mechanically reduce rental options for low-income people”. Another concern is that rent control rules in key cities will make it difficult for owners to garner an acceptable return on renovations where they do carry them out. In Paris, renovations have become a flashpoint within jointly owned apartment buildings, known as copropriétés, because costly projects require majority approval, while a unanimous vote is needed to take out loans. Laure Gallard has been lobbying her neighbours in a 10-unit, 1920s building to hire an expert to map out the renovations it needs, but has had little success. “I think they are in denial because they do not want to know and are afraid of the cost that lies ahead of us,” said the 34-year-old architect. Some owners of F- or G-rated homes are simply trying to sell. According to real estate website Se Loger, almost 20 per cent of the homes for sale in the first half of 2023 were poorly insulated ones, double the level in 2021. Thomas Lefebvre, data scientist at Se Loger, said there was no guarantee that buyers would renovate. “If we’re just removing homes from the rental market without spurring renovations, then it’s not really a win for the environment,” he said. Jacques Baudrier, a deputy mayor in Paris in charge of construction, refuses to despair. The city has spent some €2.5 billion in 10 years to renovate public buildings and schools, and plans to update all low-income housing by 2050. “We’ve made a lot of progress in the public sector, but in the private housing market, things are going far too slowly,” he said. The city has been holding monthly workshops in town halls to inform people about subsidies and offer advice. At one event in June, some 600 people came to trade tips on insulation, shutters, and heating and cooling systems. “Initially people were really worried,” said Baudrier, “but now they are getting into it”. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023 Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phoneFind The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to dateOur In The News podcast is now published daily - Find the latest episode here",https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2024/01/01/its-a-nightmare-landlords-in-a-bind-as-france-imposes-tough-new-emissions-rules/,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/mD4qKGFgp_FwfJVhtvrMxOap0wg=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/V2Z6Z2ZN65AG3EZUZZU5WUF37A.jpg,2024-01-01 13:00:00,Leila Abboud,['Leila Abboud'],en,ie,-0.093
175581001,ICOS president: 2024 is the year to address &#8216;water quality&#8217; issues,"One of the key issues that will dominate 2024 for Ireland’s farming communities is “water quality”, according to the president of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society (ICOS). The Co. Tipperary dairy farmer, Edward Carr – who took up the role of president of ICOS in 2023 – said that it is crucially important that water quality is “stabilised” as part of Ireland’s campaign to retain a nitrates derogation, after the current derogation expires on January 1, 2026. He believes that Irish farmers are completely committed to improving water quality and protecting the environment. “There are big challenges and every farmer recognises that – there are environmental issues, and there are constraints and that is a daily factor of life now, but farmers have embraced a range of actions and adopted new initiatives – they have not stood still when it comes to the environment and what is being asked of them. “Farmers know they have to get it right when it comes to water quality not only because it is the key to securing another nitrates derogation but because that is what we all want to do – we want to improve water quality and we are also working hard on climate change challenges. “We’re on course to achieve the 2030 emission reduction targets for agriculture, and we’re probably the only industry in Ireland that’s going to come anywhere near achieving that,” Carr added. Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands are currently the only EU member states to have a nitrates derogation. Denmark’s derogation permitting a maximum stocking rate of 230 kg [of organic nitrogen (N)/ha] expires in July 2024, and the country is currently involved in discussions about an extension to the derogation. Meanwhile, the Netherlands’ derogation is set to be phased out by the end of 2025. Next year, the Netherlands will be permitted a maximum stocking rate of up to 210 kg N/ha in “nutrient polluted areas” and 230 kg N/ha in other areas. These values are set to drop further in 2025, and there will be no derogation in place in the Netherlands after December 2025. According to Carr, this change in direction across Europe highlights why water quality will play such a key role in Ireland’s next discussions to secure a new nitrates derogation. But, in the first instance he said that the reduction in the maximum limit for derogation farmers to 220 kg N/ha from today (January 1, 2024) will create significant challenges for some. “There will clearly be consequences that will be felt right across agriculture, because it will impact on family farms, and it is what those implications will be in 2024 that we now have to prepare for,” he warned. According to Carr, 2023 was a very difficult year for many farming families – for dairy farmers the drop in milk prices was hard to bear coming off record prices the year before, across the board input prices remained stubbornly high in some areas, and weather conditions proved frustrating throughout the year. On top of that, the president of ICOS said many farmers felt that there was an air of negativity around farming in relation to environmental challenges. Carr hopes that 2024 will be a more positive year for farming communities on a number of fronts. “It would be nice for farmers to get the recognition they deserve in 2024 for the work they do, for what they produce and for the changes they are making to protect the environment. “Yes, there are challenges and we all have to work together to meet those challenges, but I am hoping that it will be a positive year for farmers. We saw coming towards the end of 2023 how commodity markets were improving, and that should be a good sign for the year ahead,” he added.",https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/icos-president-2024-is-the-year-to-address-water-quality-issues/,https://cdn.agriland.ie/uploads/2023/07/Riversunshine.jpeg,2024-01-01 13:00:00,Francess McDonnell,['Francess McDonnell'],en,ie,-0.191
175678975,Mental hospitals warehoused the sick. Congress wants to let them try again.  - POLITICO,"“It is no longer the 1960s, and there is no longer the same stigma against the treatment of mental health,” said GOP Rep. Michael Burgess, a doctor representing Dallas’ affluent northern suburbs who sponsored a House bill to change the rule. The House passed it Dec. 12. It would give states the option to treat Medicaid patients suffering from addiction for up to a month in a mental hospital on the government’s dime. The Senate Finance Committee approved a similar provision in November, so its prospects of enactment are good. Burgess’ co-sponsor was Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York City’s poorest section, the South Bronx, who has spent time in the hospital for his own mental health struggles. Public health groups including the Treatment Advocacy Center and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, as well as state Medicaid directors, support the change. They say the 1965 rule barring Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and lower-middle income, from funding hospital treatment has had unintended consequences: a lack of psychiatric beds for people who need them. Instead, they said, many vulnerable people end up on the streets, in emergency rooms, in jails or dead. They say the policy also perpetuates discrimination against people who suffer from drug addiction and mental illness compared to those with physical conditions, for which there’s no such exclusion. Republicans in Congress agree. Democrats are divided. New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee that shepherded the bill, resisted the change, wary of a return to institutionalizing people with mental illness instead of caring for them in their homes, ideally, with a team of specialized health and social workers. “We know that one of the best ways to help people in recovery is to ensure they have access to care in their communities,” he said. Pallone ultimately relented because Republicans agreed to improve Medicaid coverage for some incarcerated people with substance use disorder. But fears of reinstitutionalization have also animated civil rights advocates who support the restriction on Medicaid funds. They fear a slippery slope back to warehousing the sick and point to states like California and New York that are already experimenting with forcing patients into care. Lifting the Medicaid rule would reduce pressure to do what’s really needed, said Lewis Bossing, senior staff attorney at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law: increase services in communities. “People have better outcomes in terms of reduced hospitalization rates, reduced criminal legal system involvement, increased employment, increased measures of social integration when they’re served in the community, … versus having to be at an institution to get care,” he said. The rise and fall of the mental hospital States started building mental health hospitals in the 1800s, aiming to provide people with severe mental illness with care instead of throwing them in jail. But the hospitals soon became overcrowded, understaffed and underfinanced. Abuse was rife, according to an investigation published in Life Magazine in 1946: Patients were restrained for days, thrown into solitary confinement, starved and sometimes beaten to death. More than half a million people were in state mental health hospitals in 1963, half of them in facilities housing more than 3,000 people, President John F. Kennedy said in a speech that year. Kennedy laid out a plan for states to build comprehensive community mental health centers, with federal support. They would combine diagnostic services, emergency psychiatric units, inpatient and outpatient services and rehabilitation. The law establishing Medicaid two years later prohibited federal money from paying for care in mental health care facilities with more than 16 beds to avoid pouring money into what Kennedy called outdated institutional care. The rule now covers people between 21 and 64 years old. Many state hospitals closed but the community mental health system, as Kennedy envisioned it, never came to fruition, advocates on both sides of the debate say. Those who don’t want the Medicaid funding ban repealed would like states and the federal government to focus on building that system, while those who want to see the policy gone say both community and hospital care are needed to provide people with what they need, depending on their circumstances. A person diagnosed with mental illness and substance use disorder needs inpatient care for doctors to stabilize them, argued Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a gastroenterologist and top member of the two committees with power over the policy. “The people who were so opposed to this because they still want to do it in an outpatient [facility], you wonder if they’ve ever actually lived with somebody who is seriously psychotic,” Cassidy said. Over the last decade, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has started allowing states to use federal dollars to pay for care in mental health hospitals for a limited time, as long as they obtain a waiver. Thirty-six states now have a waiver to treat people with substance use disorder and a dozen states have a waiver for treating other mental illnesses in psychiatric hospitals. California found that its waiver to provide medication-assisted treatment for people with substance use disorder in mental hospitals helped individuals “who need a relatively intensive level of care for short-term stabilization of acute needs,” said Ann Carroll, the California Department of Health Care Services’ spokesperson. Even so, the system as it stands is failing to provide state-of-the-art care to many patients. One-third of the 1.5 million Medicaid enrollees with opioid use disorder, for example, did not receive medication treatment in 2021, according to the HHS inspector general. The 2018 SUPPORT Act, a landmark law meant to provide prevention, treatment and recovery for people with opioid addiction, gave states a new, albeit temporary, choice to provide care in psychiatric hospitals for up to a month without having to obtain a waiver. That option, which only South Dakota and Tennessee have taken, expired in September. The SUPPORT Act reauthorization bill the House passed in mid-December would reup the option and make it permanent. Pallone argued at a House Energy and Commerce hearing this summer that the low uptake showed that the waivers were sufficient. But Burgess and other Republicans said the waivers were burdensome and that making the option permanent would incentivize more states to use it. The Senate Finance Committee also voted in November to make the option permanent. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who introduced the legislation with Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, emphasized the 30-day limit and the requirement to provide medication. She described medication treatment — using drugs like buprenorphine to wean patients off stronger opioids — as “the gold standard for treating addiction.” It’s a rare issue on which Republicans aren’t at odds with the public health establishment. A repeal of the funding ban wouldn’t mean a return to the 1965 mental health care model “because that is just not where the system is today, that’s not where the clinical understanding is today and that’s not where any of the conversation is today,” said Jack Rollins, the director of federal policy at the National Association of Medicaid Directors. Forced care and the slippery slope But there’s still a powerful perception among many in the public that mental hospitals are akin to prisons and that opening the door to voluntary care will lead to forced treatment. When some people think of mental hospitals, they see the one in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, or its 1975 film adaptation in which Jack Nicholson played a patient who was saner than the nurse caring for him. “A faulty assumption is that [mental health institutions] are like therapeutic settings. We know there’s a history in this country of institutions not being particularly therapeutic places,” Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law’s Bossing said. He pointed to reports in recent years from Washington’s disability rights watchdog alleging abuse and neglect at one public and one private mental health hospital in the capital. Representatives of the institutions said they were investigating the accusations and would make changes if necessary. In 2021, Virginia announced and quickly reversed a decision to close five of the state’s eight psychiatric hospitals to new admissions due to overcrowding and understaffing. And reinstitutionalization, albeit on a small scale, is happening. New York has sent about 130 people per week, involuntarily, to hospitals for psychiatric evaluation since May as part of a plan by Mayor Eric Adams to treat people who are unable to meet their basic needs. On the other side of the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has included ways to compel people into care in his mental health system overhaul. In March, Californians will decide on a $6.4 billion bond proposal Newsom has pitched to build nearly 25,000 psychiatric and addiction beds. Representatives of community mental health organizations in California plan to oppose the changes. In New York City, a group of civil rights lawyers filed a class-action suit against Adams’ directive and want more data on its implementation to see whether it’s disproportionately affecting people of color. Weighing the politics Still, Newsom and Adams are reacting to growing public and political pressure caused by a massive crisis of homelessness and drug addiction. Drug use spiked during the Covid pandemic, as evidenced by the record levels of fatal overdoses — now more than 100,000 a year. Homelessness rose by 12 percent between 2022 and 2023 nationwide as rents surged and pandemic-era aid ended. More than 650,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2023, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. California is home to the most unhoused people of any state — some 181,000 people — followed by New York, with some 103,000. Politicians fear open-air drug markets and tent encampments in their cities could hurt them at election time. And they’re increasingly confident that caring for more of those suffering on the streets in mental hospitals won’t become a similar political liability. “It doesn’t have to become a warehouse, you know, ‘One Flew Over a Cuckoo’s Nest’. Absolutely not. That’s wrong, it should not happen,” Cassidy said.",https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/01/mental-hospitals-drug-users-congress-00132671,https://static.politico.com/2c/6a/5ccb8abd4b3592b0babf52ab67b9/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1780559851,2024-01-01 13:00:00,Carmen Paun,['Carmen Paun'],en,us,0.007
175678977,2024 is a record year for world elections. Here’s what to watch.  - POLITICO,"“We will know whether democracy lives or dies by the end of 2024,” said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, founder of the investigative news site Rappler in the Philippines and author of “How to Stand Up to a Dictator.” In Europe, establishment parties are bracing for a potential surge from the far right within the European Parliament, including Euroskeptic groups that aim to undermine the EU institutions meant to maintain peace across the continent’s 27-member bloc. In Asia, Taiwan’s election could escalate tensions in the Indo-Pacific, threatening to drag in Washington and other allies as Taipei and Beijing increasingly butt heads over the disputed island. And in Africa, elections in Senegal, South Africa, Mali and Chad could shape the trajectory of multilateral institutions across the continent. In North America, the U.S. isn’t alone in facing a closely watched presidential race: Mexico is holding a vote that could impact cooperation on critical trade and fraught border security issues with its northern neighbor. Tony Banbury, president of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a non-governmental organization which tracks global votes, said while ”authoritarians are deploying a sophisticated playbook to gain and hold on to power,” he also sees “democratic forces are fighting back.” The bumper crop of elections also raises questions about new technologies and misinformation online, putting a strain on cybersecurity and social media efforts to mitigate risks of manipulation. “2024 will be an election year unlike any other and this will bring unprecedented challenges to online platforms who will be working to protect the integrity of elections online,” said Katie Harbath, who has advised Republican campaigns on digital strategy and previously worked as director of public policy at Facebook. “Not only will they have a lot of countries to cover — all with different languages, cultures and regulations — but new tools such as AI that they need to write new rules for.” U.S. headlines will be dominated by the domestic showdown. Here’s a look at other key elections to watch around the world. Washington’s Asian ally: Taiwan Taiwanese voters will head to the polls in 2024’s first major election to choose a new president on Jan. 13 amid deepening fears that China might invade the island, which Biden has repeatedly said Washington would help fend off. The frontrunner is Lai Ching-te, the current vice president from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Lai chose Taiwanese envoy to the U.S. Hsiao Bi-khim — also a close confidant of incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen — as his running mate. This sends a signal to Washington that with Hsiao at his side, Lai will continue Tsai’s measured policy toward Beijing and be mindful of U.S. concerns. Lai will face Hou Yu-ih, the standard-bearer for the Kuomintang party, which ruled Taiwan from the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 through 2000. The Kuomintang is more friendly to Beijing and explicitly advocates for “reunification” as a key plank of its party platform. Hou and his running mate, Jaw Shaw-kong, are warning that electing Lai and Hsiao would result in a war between China and Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory despite the fact the Chinese Communist Party has never ruled the island. Also running is centrist Ko Wen-je. Billionaire CEO of major tech supplier Foxconn, Terry Gou, ran as an independent, but dropped out of the race in November. Beijing despises Lai and Hsiao and has placed them and their families on (unenforceable) sanction lists for their pro-independence sympathies. China’s optimal election result is a Kuomingtang victory that would open the door to renewing and expanding cross-Strait economic links aimed at pulling the self-governing island closer into China’s orbit of influence. Washington follows a “One China Policy” hinged on the peaceful resolution of Taiwan’s status and opposes any move to change the cross-Strait status quo by force as Beijing has threatened, a policy that includes providing Taiwan defensive weaponry. Biden has stated multiple times that the U.S. would militarily intervene in a conflict between Taipei and Beijing, roiling already frayed ties with China. Africa’s democracy-defining elections Elections are set to be held across over a dozen countries in Africa, including in leading members of continental peace-keeping and economic organizations, as well as in countries where militaries overthrew democratically elected governments in coups in recent years. The outcomes of these elections will impact the brewing battle among foreign countries for influence on the continent, with the United States and Western allies vying to act as a counterweight to Russian and Chinese investment and security partnerships. It will also affect the trajectory of democratization and test the ability of multilateral organizations on the continent to protect civilian rule and discourage military coups. The governing parties of Senegal and South Africa are hoping to keep a grip on power, but face tough fights from opposition groups. Both are forceful voices in the African Union and Senegal is one of the leading countries in the Economic Community of West African States, organizations which hold considerable sway on regional priorities like trade integration, security policy and human rights. Senegal and South Africa hold weight on the continent as more economically prosperous and politically stable countries, helping to shape continental trade and political integration. South Africa’s election will also be economically significant — the ruling ANC party has embraced trade and investment ties with China and Russia as part of the BRICS alliance (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). The South African economy has also lagged under ANC mismanagement, exacerbating inequality and stagnation in one of the continent’s wealthiest countries. Mali and Chad — which have each been under military rule since coups over the past three years — have both said they would hold presidential elections in 2024. Mali’s junta initially set February for its ballot, but postponed it, while dates for elections in Chad have yet to be announced. If these elections occur, which is far from certain, that could encourage other African countries that have also experienced recent coups to move back toward democratic rule, including Niger, Gabon and Sudan. If they don’t, it will set back the yearslong efforts from ECOWAS and the African Union to restore civilian rule in those countries and undercut the legitimacy of the two organizations. Protests expected: Belarus, Russia, Iran Analysts don’t expect legislative elections in Belarus and Iran, or a presidential ballot in Russia, to immediately change policy in those countries, but protests are likely to emerge around these votes that could prove disruptive and hard to control. Such unrest could distract each government from their involvement in major international conflicts — for Iran, in the Middle East, for Russia and Belarus, in Ukraine. It could also further heighten tensions with Western countries, which have imposed sanctions over each country’s treatment of dissenters in recent years. When Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared victory in the widely contested 2020 presidential election, winning a sixth term in office, it prompted the biggest anti-government demonstrations the country had seen since the fall of the Soviet Union, spanning months. The opposition refuted the results, backed by international allies like the United States and EU. Four years later, concerns about Lukashenko’s authoritarianism have not abated, raising worries among critics that he could try to further consolidate power in the upcoming parliamentary vote in February, ahead of the next presidential ballot in 2025. Meanwhile, Lukashenko’s close ally Russian President Vladimir Putin is up for reelection himself on March 15, in a vote he’s widely expected to win after more than 20 years in power. Like Lukashenko, Putin is also expected to face protests. But one of his most vocal critics, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, is currently imprisoned and has had breaks in contact with his allies, hampering the ability of Putin’s detractors to organize. Iran’s election to fill seats in the Majlis on March 1 will be the country’s first vote since mass demonstrations in 2022 gripped the Islamic Republic following the death of a young woman who had been detained for allegedly not following state rules on proper dress. Disputed election results have fanned the flames of dissent in Iran in the past, including the 2009 Green Movement protests, considered at the time the biggest demonstrations since the 1979 revolution. Subcontinent strained: Pakistan and India Both Pakistan and India are heading into contentious elections in which the winners could reshape international relations, altering dynamics in the strategic Indo-Pacific region, where, like Africa, the U.S. and its allies hope to bolster ties as a bulwark against Chinese and Russian influence. India is set to hold general elections between April and May, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party is expected to hold on to its majority, if not gain seats, in the Lok Sabha. But India’s opposition parties accuse Modi of undermining the country’s democratic institutions, jailing and intimidating journalists and using state investigative agencies to target political opponents. They also accuse the BJP of sanctioning and condoning violence against India’s Muslim minority and promoting Hindutva, a school of Hindu nationalist thought that wants to cement Hindu hegemony in India. Modi and his allies have said the Indian government’s actions against journalists and activists are needed to combat “terrorism” by Islamist and Maoist groups. Pakistan, meanwhile, is still grappling with the aftermath of populist Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ousting. Khan, a famed cricket player, was first elected in 2018 and promoted better ties with India and China. He was removed from office in April 2022 after failing a no-confidence motion and was arrested in May 2023 on corruption charges, which sparked widespread protests at the time and continues to roil the South Asian country. Pakistan’s Parliament was dissolved last August ahead of anticipated elections in November. However, a dispute over the boundaries of some electoral constituencies prompted Pakistan’s electoral commission to delay the general election until February 2024. Strict new social media laws will be a factor in both countries’ campaigns after they each moved to rein in platforms in recent years under the auspices of combating disinformation, raising fears of censorship from some opposition forces. Continent-shaker: European Parliament The European Parliament election is the second-largest vote by population in 2024, behind India. Traditional parties are nervous that a possible rise on the European far right could coincide with a Trump comeback. That scenario could again rankle transatlantic ties that have just started to repair under Biden, complicating coordination with the continent’s closest ally as the European Union continues to face the Russia-Ukraine war on its doorstep. The shock success of populist, Euroskeptic leader Geert Wilders in The Netherlands was the most recent sign of tides turning, with polls pointing to major gains for far-right parties under the European Parliament’s Identity and Democracy group in the June vote. The European far-right has campaigned less on the anti-Islam, anti-migrant rhetoric that defined its early rise in the 2000s and 2010s, shifting its approach to domestic issues like housing and economic inequality in countries like Italy, Portugal, France, Germany and the Netherlands, helping them to make steady, and surprising, electoral gains. While Identity and Democracy parties aren’t expected to win the most seats in the Parliament vote, they’re currently running in third place — up from their current sixth — according to POLITICO’s Poll of Polls. This could give them fuel to push for prominent Parliament committee leadership posts, which they were blocked from taking after the prior 2019 election. It’s unlikely that most important positions will actually end up in the hands of the far-right. Italy’s far-right leader Giorgia Meloni, though, will be seeking an influential commissioner. A number of these parties’ leaders, including Wilders, have also expressed skepticism to continued Ukraine aid, presenting a potential clash with allies like the U.S. as the war against Russia drags on. The neighbor: Mexico Mexico is heading to the polls on June 2, in a presidential election that could have major consequences for collaboration with Washington on border issues, trade and broader policy toward the rest of Latin America. Incumbent President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is term-limited, but he’s looking to extend the hold on power of the populist, left-wing Morena party he founded. Under López Obrador, Mexico has regularly played hardball with the Trump and Biden administrations on border security and trade. Morena’s candidate and the current election frontrunner is former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, a scientist by training and close follower of López Obrador’s brand of economic populism. She’s expected to continue the current government’s social assistance programs to help Mexico’s impoverished urban communities, while pursuing a similarly assertive foreign policy. Sheinbaum has not shied away from courting Chinese and Russian investment in Mexico, both as a presidential candidate and as mayor, and has said Mexico should not have a “relationship of submission” with the U.S. A change in Mexico’s Constitution in 2021 under López Obrador that allows presidents to be removed from office halfway through their term by a national popular vote has also come under greater scrutiny lately. Critics warn that López Obrador could use this to control the direction of successive Morena governments, dangling the threat of removal and leveraging his popularity with Mexican voters if future presidents stray from his ideological vision. López Obrador and his supporters, including Sheinbaum, have defended the provision, saying it allows for greater democratic oversight of political leaders. Opposition parties are rallying together behind independent Senator Xóchitl Gálvez, who’s gunning to be Mexico’s first female Indigenous president. Gálvez’s supporters worry that another Morena presidency will set relations with the U.S. back, pointing to the various times López Obrador snubbed meeting Biden, and cause Mexico to experience further economic stagnation. They also criticize his public attacks against Gálvez and attempts to require elections for members of Mexico’s electoral commission. The transatlantic partner: U.K. U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak technically has until January 2025 to schedule an election, but he is likely to head to the ballot box earlier if opinion polls narrow or continued infighting within his ruling Conservative Party becomes unmanageable. While Sunak’s main rival is a moderate who has pledged to continue the U.K.’s support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia, a change in government could affect the U.K.'s approach toward the European Union after leaving the bloc in 2020, reshape the U.K.’s defense priorities and usher in changes to migration and foreign aid policies. The “special relationship” with the United States also could change drastically depending on who wins, potentially dooming or bolstering London’s efforts to press Washington for a major trade deal it hoped would help boost economic ties after Brexit. Personal affinity between British prime ministers and U.S. presidents has greatly impacted the relationship throughout history, something which will also depend on the winner of the U.S. election as well. The Tories, the largest party in the House of Commons since 2010, are facing significant public discontent over the economy, scandals related to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Covid-19 response and an ongoing crisis with the National Health Service. Divisions within the Tory ranks over migration and bad blood following the ouster of Johnson in 2022 have added to the party’s grim prospects. Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer is riding high with his group currently enjoying 43 percent support, according to POLITICO’s Poll of Polls, compared with the Tories at 25 percent — although questions remain about how much of this is driven by genuine enthusiasm for Labour rather than discontent with the Tories.

175587813,"New year to bring the coldest storm of the season so far, officials say","The first week of 2024 is expected to be a cold and wet one in Los Angeles, according to the National Weather Service. There's a 20% to 40% chance of rain into New Year's morning. People camping out for the Rose Parade may have seen some precipitation, but the parade itself should be mostly dry, said Rich Thompson of the weather service. That's good news for parade organizers, who were hoping the event — which begins at 8 a.m. at the corner of Green Street and Orange Grove Boulevard in Pasadena — will draw crowds nearly as large as those before the pandemic. Officials said last-minute tickets would be available Monday morning. “We feel good that the crowds will be strong again this year,"" Tournament of Roses Chief Executive David Eads told The Times last week. Highs on New Year's Day are expected to be in the upper 50s to mid-60s, officials said. The storm that officials are calling the coldest of the season so far is forecast to arrive later this week when a cold front sweeps down the coast, bringing light to moderate showers Wednesday and Thursday and some snowfall in the mountains. Rainfall is expected in much of Southern California with that storm, ranging from about half an inch to an inch, officials said. Highs are expected to be in the 50s midweek, which is cooler than normal for this time of year, weather service meteorologist David Gomberg told The Times. There's also a 20% chance of snow at elevations as low as 4,000 feet — which would affect the Grapevine — by late Wednesday, officials said. The region was also expected to continue to see high surf conditions throughout the week, and the wet weather could continue Saturday and Sunday, Thompson said. A high surf advisory was extended through Monday morning, though waves were not expected to be as high as they were last week, when beaches were pounded by massive swells, leading to injuries and beach closures.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-01-01/new-years-southern-california-weather-rain-snow,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67c396d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+174/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5a%2F25%2F2b01b7eb4d9ba3173d95b327f22b%2F1392097-me-high-surf,2024-01-01 13:00:03,Paloma Esquivel,['Paloma Esquivel'],en,us,-0.238
175567591,Peer support line for first responders and military looking for Alberta volunteers,"For decades, Karyn Carty and Peter Seigenthaler worked in the police services, dealing with some of the most difficult and traumatic cases. But now, they work directly with other first responders and military members who are looking to speak with colleagues who know exactly what they’re going through. Over the last five years, Boots on the Ground has been answering anonymous calls from those on the front lines of society’s most pressing issues. The organization launched its Alberta chapter in September and has already helped dozens of active and retired police officers, firefighters, medical professionals and military members. “If you want to talk, we’ll listen,” said Seigenthaler, a former Calgary police officer, duty sergeant and inspector. “If you want advice from our own lived experience, we’ll do that, but first and foremost we’re here to listen.” At any one time, there are three volunteers ready to answer the calls. No caller ID is shown and callers are never asked for their names, occupation or departments. “Everybody with Boots on the Ground is like-minded,” said Carty, a police communications expert and former 911 dispatcher. “It helps the people calling to know that we’re like-minded. I believe it’s helping.” During the holidays, the organization tends to see a rise in calls since first responders rarely get any sort of additional time off. “There’s always an expectation of an uptick in calls,” Carty said. “And from a peer support standpoint … they will utilize an organization like Boots on the Ground because they are suffering.” To try and help with the rise in demand, the organization is calling on more active and retired members of the community to step up and answer the calls from their colleagues. “There’s so much help needed,” Seigenthaler said. “First responders are struggling, and they often struggle in silence.” Interested volunteers can reach out through the Boots on the Ground website and if you need support, volunteers can be reached at 1-833-677-BOOT (2668).",https://globalnews.ca/news/10170239/peer-support-line-first-responders-military-alberta-volunteers/,https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/boots.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all,2024-01-01 13:00:06,Michael King,['Michael King'],en,ca,0.21

175567425,Sidhu Moosewala murder mastermind Goldy Brar declared a designated terrorist by Centre,"Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the brutal murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, was on Monday declared a designated terrorist by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). A key member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, Brar had claimed responsibility for the murder of Moosewala, who was killed in a hail of bullets in Punjab’s Mansa district on May 29, 2022. A native of Faridkot in Punjab, Brar, whose real name is Satinderjit Singh, went to Canada on a student visa in 2017. In a gazetted notification, Praveen Vashista, Additional Secretary, Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Additional Secretary, said, “And whereas, Satwinder Singh alias Satinderjit Singh alias Goldy Brar, presently residing in Brampton, Canada is associated with Babbar Khalsa International…And whereas, Babbar Khalsa International is listed as a terrorist organisation.” #JUSTIN: Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the brutal murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, declared a designated terrorist by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). @IndianExpress — Mahender Singh Manral (@mahendermanral) January 1, 2024 The notification said, “Goldy backed by a cross-border agency, was involved in multiple killings and professes radical ideology, figured in making threatening calls to pro-nationalist leaders, demanding ransom and posting the claims of killings on different social media platforms. He has been involved in smuggling of high-grade arms, ammunition and explosive materials through drones from across the border and supplying thereon for carrying out killings and also providing sharpshooters.” “Goldy and his associates have been conspiring to disrupt the peace, communal harmony and law and order in Punjab through nefarious designs including sabotage, the raising of terror modules, carrying out targeted killings, and other anti-national activities. A Red Corner Notice was issued against him by Interpol Secretariat General (IPSG), Lyon, France and a non-bailable warrant on December 12, 2022, was issued against him…A Look Out Circular was also on June 15, 2022,” it said. The notification added that the Central government believes that Goldy is involved in terrorism and he is to be added as a terrorist in the Fourth Schedule to the UAPA. While claiming responsibility for Mooosewala’s murder, Brar had said in a Facebook post, “Sachin Bishnoi Dhattaranwali, Lawrence Bishnoi, and I are behind the killing of Sidhu Moosewala.” The gangster had claimed that he killed Moosewala to avenge the death of Youth Akali Dal leader Vicky Middukhera. Brar had also claimed responsibility for the murder of Dera follower Pardeep Singh Kataria in Kotkapura in 2022. An accused in the 2015 Bargari sacrilege case, Kataria was out on bail and was shot dead at his shop by a group of six men on November 11 that year.

175579221,Some Black People Seeks to Show Improv Is for Anyone,"When Jessica Silas started taking classes at the Improv Shop two years ago, she realized all the improv groups around her were predominantly white. But soon, that reality will be no more. Silas’ new all-Black improv team, Some Black People, will be making its big debut Saturday, January 20, at the Improv Shop (3960 Chouteau Avenue, theimprovshop.com) at 8 p.m. With its creation, she hopes to show that improv can be for anyone and that comics’ differences only make the humor better. “I want people to see, first of all, that improv is really fun and entertaining,” she says. “And second of all, that diversity is important. It's really good to feel represented and see yourself on stage.” It took about four months for Silas to pull the group together after first getting the inkling that she’d like to be on stage herself. “[Improv is] not super male dominated, but it's like a male thing for the most part,” Silas says. “One night I went to a show, and I saw an all-female team called Toxic, and it really lit my fire because I was just taking the classes for fun. But once I saw the all-female team, that inspired me to perform.” When it was her turn to come up with a team, she wanted to create her own version of Toxic to help inspire a more diverse atmosphere at the Improv Shop. “But there wasn’t a lot of interest in improv, I don't think, from a lot of Black people,” she explains. “So I just kept going to the shop, and when I would see Black people in shows, I would introduce myself to them. Once I found about six people, we started hanging out and decided to make a team.” Some Black People specializes in long-form improv that brings together what each individual learned at the Improv Shop. “We have a lot of pause moments and emotional connections,” Silas says. “You'll see a lot of scenes between husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, mothers and sons. You know, a lot of high emotional connections with humor and realism kind of mixed in. So it's really not what people expect. It's a lot of fun.” The group’s main goal is to make the crowd laugh, but Silas hopes viewers see the importance of differences between people. “With this team, we really want to show that when you do have different communities involved within one larger community, you get different things, and that’s really beautiful,” she says. “That little bit of shared culture can make for something really magical.” Tickets are $12 and can be purchased on the Improv Shop’s website.",https://www.riverfronttimes.com/arts/some-black-people-seeks-to-show-improv-is-for-anyone-41539732,https://media1.riverfronttimes.com/riverfronttimes/imager/u/original/41539749/someblackpeople2.jpg,2024-01-01 13:02:00,Paula Tredway,['Paula Tredway'],en,us,0.212
175574247,On the Historical Disunity of Ukrainians and Russians,"On the eve of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Vladimir Putin published his essay, “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.” In it he explains why he believes Russians and Ukrainians are “one people – a single whole.” Putin amplifies the idea that Ukraine should be and always was a part of Russia. Many in the West are indifferent to Russia’s invasion, some even go as far as to say: “Why should we care about a boundary dispute?” Contrary to Putin’s statement, Ukraine is fundamentally different than Russia. It is important to restate the central principle which divides Ukraine and Russia: their systems of government. Yes, Ukrainians and Russians have a common predecessor in Kyivan-Rus dating back 1,000 years. But just as families can grow apart and seek different paths, Ukrainians and Russians have grown apart over the centuries. They have adopted fundamentally different views of the relationship between the individual and the state. The history is long and complex, but a concise background for the reader is in order. Where the histories split Ukraine and Russia trace their histories back 1,000 years to Kyivan-Rus (or simply Rus). The collection of principalities known as Rus had its capital in the city of Kyiv. Rus lands occupied the river systems between the White Sea near Finland and the Black Sea, part of a flourishing trade route that linked the Scandinavians and Byzantine Empire. Out of the many Rus principalities, two of them are most relevant for this discussion. The first is Vladimir-Suzdal in the northeast of Rus, which later became part of Muscovy with its capital Moscow. The second is the principality of Galicia-Volhynia in the far west of Rus, which later became part of present-day Ukraine. In the 13th century, Galicia-Volhynia was ruled by Prince Danylo and his sons. Rus prospered for around 400 years. Among the Rus princes, the Grand Prince of Kyiv was viewed as first among equals, not an absolute ruler, with frequent infighting among the princes for status and power. With its loose political structure and lack of coherence, Rus was vulnerable to an organized military society like the Mongols. The Mongol Empire, ruled first by Genghis Khan, and then by his sons, was the largest land empire the world has ever known. It stretched across Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to present day Poland. The Mongols first entered Eastern Europe around 1223, after having first conquered much of China, and the great nations of Central Asia. During this time even great centralized powers like Persia fell to the Mongols. The loose structure of Rus could not resist the Mongol war machine. In the end, the Mongols conquered almost all of Rus. Grand Prince Yuri II of Vladimir-Suzdal was killed in 1238 at the Battle of Sit River and the capital Kyiv was razed to the ground in December of 1240. Regarding the Mongol invasions, Putin glosses over the topic in his essay, “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.” Offering a cursory history he states: “The northeastern part of Rus fell under the control of the [Mongols] but retained limited sovereignty. The southern and western Russian lands largely became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which – most significantly – was referred to in historical records as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Russia.” Putin is correct that Vladimir-Suzdal and Galicia-Volhynia had differing experiences during and after the Mongol invasions. As Putin describes above, Vladimir-Suzdal, with its lands in the northeast, was under direct vassalage of the Mongol invaders, and retained little sovereignty. The cities in Vladimir-Suzdal began to prosper under the control of the Mongols due to access to trade routes to Asia, like the Silk Road. A great exchange of culture, ideas, and goods occurred. Putin’s crucial lacuna: contact with the seeds of democracy Putin leaves out a crucial bit about the western Rus lands of Galicia-Volhynia. He states a half-truth. Western Rus lands became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ruthenia, not “Russia.” Further, Putin ignores the fact that western Rus lands in Galicia-Volhynia retained sovereignty for well over 100 years under Prince Danylo and his successors until 1340. Danylo’s lands prospered, and even grew, and did not experience the type of vassalage the Mongols were exerting over Vladimir-Suzdal. In his essay, Vladimir Putin leaves out any mention of Danylo, who is a crucial figure in understanding Ukraine. Unlike Vladimir-Suzdal, which had greater ties with Asia due to Mongol vassalage, Galicia-Volhynia was now becoming a part of Europe under Danylo. Danylo’s rule was characterized by his political maneuvering to appease Mongol generals. He met with Mongol generals on numerous occasions, accepting them as “rulers” in principle. Danylo established ties with Hungary and Poland during these times. This was all done with the intention of deterring the Mongols and expanding and strengthening Galicia-Volhynia. Danylo appealed to the Pope Innocent IV in Rome to send a crusade to help him expel the Mongols. Although the Pope did not send troops, the Pope granted Danylo the title, King of Ruthenia. Ruthenian being the Latin term for “people of Rus.” Ukrainians, before calling themselves Ukrainians, called themselves Ruthenians well into the 20th century. Danylo’s son Lev further expanded the territories of Galicia-Volhynia. He facilitated the growth of Lviv, the major city in the region, named after Lev himself. Lev’s son Andrew continued his grandfather Danylo’s work, keeping firm European relations with the Poles and the 14th century German states. Eventually, Galicia-Volhynia was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Poland and Ruthenia. The people of Galicia-Volhynia, again called Ruthenians in the sources, retained control over their language and culture, and thus the foundations were laid for the Ukrainian identity, one that was European, and exposed to major European movements like the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Humanism. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ruthenia, as well as its successor, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, were characterized by a decentralized government where every noble member of the Parliament, or “Sejm,” could veto legislation. The Sejm, which included many Ruthenian members, exposed Ukrainians to the benefits and problems of democracy. (Above: Portrait of a Ruthenian woman at the Ellis Island Immigration Station, 1906. Photo colorization by Sanna Dullaway for TIME / original image: The New York Public Library) After the decline and fall of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, between 1772 and 1795 western Ukrainian lands were absorbed into the central European Hapsburg Empire (later Austro-Hungary), ushering in a period when Lviv and Milan were part of the same state. Austro-Hungary became a constitutional monarchy in 1867, and Ruthenians elected members to the legislature. Again, Ukrainian lands were part of a democratic, European state. As Europe experienced the Enlightenment, Ukrainians grew along with it. Beyond Ukrainian inclusion into Central European governments, a second foundation for freedom arose. In the south, during the 16th century, Ukraine was protected by the freedom-loving Cossacks, who elected their own leaders, and would fight anyone who tried to place limits on their freedom. The famed historian of Russia Mykola Kostomarov said of Ukraine that its “Cossack origins had made it democratic and egalitarian… they had no tsars… they had no nobility.” Moscow stuck in a Mongol mindset By contrast, Vladimir-Suzdal, and later Muscovy, was still firmly under Mongol rule until the late 15th century. By this time, Muscovite culture was heavily influenced by the Mongols – much of the nobility was of Mongol descent. However, the Mongol rule over Muscovy began to collapse with the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. The Battle on the Ugra River in 1480 marked the end of Mongol rule over Russian lands. The Grand Prince of Muscovy took the title of Tsar of all Rus. And Muscovy, only began to be called “Russia” in 1547. Muscovy and its tsars viewed strength as the primary virtue needed to expel the Mongols and protect the viability of the state. As a result, Muscovy had a view of the state that led to its constant expansion and absorption of surrounding areas for centuries. The individual was subordinated to the needs of the state, and the tsar the absolute autocrat. This was a powerful and successful model in world affairs during that violent era. It led to the defeat of the Mongols and the ever-expanding Russian Empire in successive centuries, to the point where the Russian Empire became, as Russia remains today, the largest country in the world. Today’s Russia and Vladimir Putin are the heirs of this theory of the absolute dominance of the state over the individual and the need for an autocrat to rule with an iron fist and conquer new lands. Putin has adopted all the old imperial symbols, like the double headed eagle; and his ceremonial guards wear 19th-century imperial uniforms. Today many Russians are deeply aware of their history, and support Putin in his war against Ukraine. In fact, many Russians still have favorable views of Stalin despite his horrific cruelties. Russia’s absolute disregard for its battlefield casualties both in World War II and during this current war with Ukraine is an example of the consequences of such a system. This history makes clear: Ukraine was long a part of Europe, rather than Putin’s “Russian world.” When the 13th century Mongol invasions destroyed Rus, Galicia-Volhynia and Vladimir-Suzdal were split. This split initiated the divergence of the Ukrainian and Russian identities and styles of government. Today’s European trajectory The history explains why today Ukrainians are a European and democratic people who favor freedom and democracy. It explains why Ukrainians fought many battles against the ever-expanding Russian Empire, including under Petro Sahaidachny in the Polish-Muscovite War of 1605 in alliance with Poland or under Ivan Mazepa in the great Northern War of 1700-1722 in alliance with Sweden. Even the horrific Holodomor in 1932-33, when Stalin created an artificial famine and killed countless millions to break the will of the Ukrainian peasant farmers who refused to give up their land, shows the persistent freedom-loving nature of Ukrainians. (Above: Ukrainian Hetman Petro Sahaidachny at the 1621 Battle of Khotyn where he was mortally wounded. Credit: Andrey Serebryakov). Now, Ukraine is fighting for its survival against a great autocracy that denies Ukraine’s very existence. But more than just a struggle of a free people against a large and powerful neighbor, this is a struggle to define the relationship between a people and its state. Is Putin’s Russia the model we want to be victorious? Is the state supreme above all other concerns, including the rights of the individual? Or is Ukraine to survive? Do the Western ideals of freedom and democracy matter? The answers to these questions have global implications. Is the future of mankind in an era of ever more powerful Artificial Intelligence one of constant surveillance to achieve the total subordination of the individual to the state? This prospect is far more frightening than George Orwell imagined in 1984. Or do individual humans and human rights matter? Is our collective future full of light and liberty? In every nation’s history, there comes a time when it must earn its freedom. Most cannot do it alone, witness the French aid which allowed the American Revolution to succeed against the most powerful country in the world at that time, the British Empire. Now is Ukraine’s time, and the time for all freedom-loving peoples to defend their collective future.",https://www.kyivpost.com/post/26058,https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2023/12/28/0bc2a3144a60d835b776667bb5fac336.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg,2024-01-01 13:05:00,James Terpak,['James Terpak'],en,ua,0.089
175612617,"&#039;We need more truth and love, as pathetic as that sounds&#039;: President Čaputová&#039;s New Year&#039;s address","Dear Fellow Citizens, I wish you a lot of health, comfort and understanding on the threshold of the new year. Today we commemorate the 31st anniversary of our statehood. I wish for 2024 to bring more peace and stability. Our private wishes and expectations for the coming year may differ. But at this moment, almost all of us maintain the hope that they will be fulfilled. That even if complications and difficulties arise, we will manage to solve them and things will get better. However, in the difficult times we have been living in the last few years, even our hope is often confronted by harsh reality. We experienced too many crises, a source of uncertainty and which placed many in difficult life situations. The past year was no exception. We have experienced numerous political conflicts, three prime ministers, a fierce election campaign and early elections. It was undoubtedly a challenging year, full of changes, expectations, their fulfilment, but also disappointments. Early elections probably resulted in the biggest change. A change of government is also a part of democracy. However, elections do not change society, the democratic values ​​on which it is based must not be changed. And if there is an effort towards fundamental changes, then it can happen only after a thorough analysis and honest discussion. Thus, we need a continuity of values when building our statehood. Not just declared, but real. Therefore, let's protect and promote our constitutional democratic values. Let's also protect the institutions whose functioning is necessary for democracy. Whether it is law enforcement agencies, free media, or non-governmental organisations. Let's continue to do so with respect and decency. So that the desire to fight does not darken anyone's mind, and so that fighting itself does not become the main meaning of our actions instead of the values ​​we wanted to protect. Building and strengthening statehood is our common duty. We may not be able to eliminate all its shortcomings and diseases right away. But that cannot be a reason to resign ourselves. We are not responsible for the outcome, but we are fully responsible for our part in it. Dear Fellow Citizens, It would be disrespectful to the truth if we told ourselves that there is no reason to disagree and be dissatisfied with some phenomena in our society. The lists are long. But let's also talk about what we can be proud of and what we can rely on in our society. The reason for pride is certainly you, our citizens, our civil society, which has been showing its maturity and solidarity for years. Active citizens and non-governmental organisations have long fulfilled important functions in the fields of social care, education, environmental protection, and in the promotion of the rights of minorities and all people without difference. We can also rely on our local governments, which once again confirmed their viability and professionalism, and were a stabilising element of the functioning of our state in changing times. The result of your work is a concrete help, sometimes even leading to systemic changes. But it always helps us trust ourselves and trust each other a little more. Dear Fellow Citizens, Help is the basis of trust, and trust is a prerequisite for a functioning state and a cohesive community. Therefore, the primary role of the state in crisis situations must be direct assistance to those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves on the verge of survival. For a long time, poverty has not only affected people who have lost their jobs, but also working people and entire families who live without savings and in conditions that threaten their dignity. Today, incomplete, single-parent families and especially children are most at risk. At the same time, we owe the most to children and the young generation. Even experts warn us that there is a gap between us and the younger generation. According to many studies, young people feel misunderstood and lonely. We observe alarming cases of bullying, young people increasingly seeking the help of psychologists and psychiatrists, and it is no longer unusual for them to take their own lives. So we must be significantly more interested in what young people are experiencing. We need to create a safe school environment for them, leave a functioning pension system, sustainable public finances and not abandon them in uncertainty in solving the climate crisis. Our mistakes, our inattention and irresponsibility will be felt more fundamentally by the generation of today's youth than by their parents. We must be anchored in the present, but we must not forget that this does not absolve us of responsibility for the future. Dear Fellow Citizens, As president, I am addressing you for the last time at this New Year's moment. When I took up the post of president, I said that if we are to successfully manage the journey from a Slovakia as it stands now to a Slovakia as it could be, we must openly talk about what helps us and what holds us back. Five years after I took office, I am convinced that one of the biggest obstacles to our development is a lack of culture, especially in politics, and the number of conflicts in our society. For many, it is also an obstacle to staying in Slovakia, and for others an obstacle to returning home. Animosity becomes a hallmark of public life. However, it also spills over into our families, households, and relationships between people. Rudeness, vulgarity and lying are not signs of strength, but of weakness. Weak people resort to them. They are impressed by such behaviour and so they repeat it. True strength lies in calmness and perspective. And the greatest strength is the ability to control yourself. It is not by chance that one attribute of democracy is the ability to exchange opinions and communicate decently, to respect other people even with different views. These characteristics and qualities proved to be a necessary prerequisite for people to coexist and form a functioning society. They are standards created over years of development. We simply need more truth and love, as pathetic as that sounds. Finally, remembering the values ​​and qualities proven over centuries does not have to be pathetic. That they are notorious is not a sign of their devaluation, but on the contrary, it confirms their validity and importance. And we still need them now. We all need more kindness and understanding in communication, in interactions, even when we disagree. Actually, especially then. Because there is always a person standing opposite us, because we all belong to the same human family. People must not feel threatened. They must feel a sense of security and belonging to their community, to their surroundings, so that they can combine their skills and strengths. Dear Fellow Citizens, Despite the difficult years we have experienced, we need to look to the future with hope. During the almost five years of my mandate, I met thousands of people, our citizens. They were exceptional stories, great talents, successful companies, excellent scientists, people in factories, villages, and cities. And every time the Slovak national anthem was played during a foreign visit, this experience was also there with me. I was there with these innumerable reasons to be proud of Slovakia. Of the country under the Tatras, which still has a long way to go, but which has already covered part of a successful path. I wish you a happy and successful new year!",https://spectator.sme.sk/c/23262916/president-zuzana-caputova-new-years-address-2024.html,https://m.smedata.sk/api-media/media/image/spectator/8/86/8656428/8656428_1200x800.png?rev=3,2024-01-01 13:09:00,"Iryna Uias, Zuzana Čaputová","['Iryna Uias', 'Zuzana Čaputová']",en,sk,-0.144

175569695,2024: Ogun monarch sets agenda for Tinubu,"A respected monarch, Onibudo of Ayetoro Budo-Ota in Ado-Odo Ota local government area of Ogun State, Oba Adewunmi Odutala, has advised the federal government to pay more attention to locally made goods in the year 2024. The monarch said if Nigeria must achieve prosperity, goods that Nigerians produce must stop coming from foreign countries into NigeriaN local markets. Oba Odutala said this at a special press briefing organised to advise the Nigerian government for the year 2024. In his words, he said, “Government should pay attention to little things that affect the lives of the common masses. We should encourage locally-made goods in 2024. Invest in local manufacturers. The FG should stop the importation of Ankara fabrics and empower Ankara factories in Nigeria. “If they want Nigerians to patronise the local market, the government should settle down and invest in local markets and we will all thrive together.” The monarch also appealed to the federal government to nip in the bud, the gradual death of Nigeria’s local languages. Just like English and mathematics, Oba Odutala advocated that the government should ensure that candidates excel in their local languages to get admitted into tertiary institutions in the country. “Encourage the speaking of local languages in government offices and schools, make local languages a compulsory subject to gain admission into our higher institutions. It is only in Nigeria we train our children with foreign languages and we want them to do well academically, it doesn't work that way, you can't use another man's language to train your children and expect them to excel. The level of intelligence is not determined by how much vocabulary they can speak. “Nations that teach their children local languages are better than us. What have we invented or gained from speaking big English? 2024 must change.” In the same vein, the monarch also urged President Bola Tinubu to work on repairing “the battered government image” to achieve citizens' trust. Oba Odutala noted that President Tinubu should ensure political officeholders fulfil their campaign promises to the people, insisting that, “Any business transacted with the absence of trust will not end well. “Government must fulfil all the promises they made. State and local governments should be ready to be accountable to the people in 2024 because we know the amount of allocation they get from the federal government. The state and local governments should think about the masses and stop blaming the federal government for their failures. They should implement social welfare for their people and stop pushing all the blame on Tinubu.”",https://dailypost.ng/2024/01/01/2024-ogun-monarch-sets-agenda-for-tinubu/,https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/President-Bola-Ahmed-Tinubu-1.jpg,2024-01-01 13:12:55,Olasunkanmi Akinlotan,['Olasunkanmi Akinlotan'],en,ng,0.071
175568335,"Trump faces $250M penalty, ban from doing business in NY when judge issues verdict this month","The new year could be off to a rough start for Donald Trump. The former president is facing $250 million in penalties and a ban on doing business in New York when the judge overseeing his civil fraud trial delivers a verdict in the case later in January. The Manhattan Supreme Court trial — which has been on hiatus since Dec. 13 — is set to resume with closing arguments on Jan. 11, and Justice Arthur Engoron has said he hopes to have a decision in the non-jury case by the end of the month. New York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking at least $250 million in repayment of alleged ill-gotten gains from Trump, 77, and his co-defendants, including his two eldest sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. The Republican 2024 presidential frontrunner is accused of exaggerating the value of his assets by billions on yearly financial statements to get better loan and insurance terms. Engoron has already found that Trump is liable for fraud, but other claims in James’ lawsuit, as well as a potential final penalty, still need to be ruled on. The judge could order Trump to pay less — or more — than what the AG is seeking, but one legal expert said it was more likely he will either rule that the ex-president owes the full $250 million, or nothing. “There has been no clear number of either ill-gotten gain or loss, so I don’t know how the judge would come up with a different number,” Evan Gotlob, a former prosecutor and white collar defense attorney, told The Post. The court has heard from some 40 witnesses since the trial started on Oct. 2, but not a lot of the testimony focused on how much each lender or insurer lost due to Trump’s alleged fraud — making it unlikely that Engoron would come up with a different number than the sum James is seeking. “I doubt the judge in this case would go above the amount because they have no basis to unless they have a forensic accountant going through an enormous organization like the Trump Organization, all their books and all the improper benefits they got,” Gotlob said. It’s also unlikely the judge would set the penalty lower than $250 million, he said. “I think it’s going to be very difficult, unless one of the judge’s clerks is a secret finance expert, to come up with a number that’s significantly lower — based on what? The evidence hasn’t really gone either way, so that there is $250 million or not,” Gotlob said. And he said judges tend to try to make financial penalties payable. “When you’re a judge you find out what they can pay whether — it’s through bankruptcy or not,” Gotlob said. “I think the Trump organization is worth between $1 billion and $3 billion… there is money to pay.” Engoron in a bombshell ruling from just before the start of trial found that Trump was liable on one of the AG’s main fraud claims and the judge revoked the Trump Organization’s business licenses. The company can continue to do business as the latter part of the decision was put on hold by an appeals court at least until Engoron issues his verdict. But even after the verdict is issued, Gotlob predicted it would be years until the case concludes as Trump is likely to appeal any negative ruling all the way to the Empire State’s top court. “This is a case that I could see, especially knowing how much the former president loves fighting decisions against him, that it’s going to go all the way up to the Court of Appeals,” Gotlob said. The earliest the case would be resolved is after the 2024 presidential election, since “courts don’t like to get involved in politics,” Gotlob suggested, adding that a final ruling could come down as late as 2025 or 2026. As for the business licenses getting revoked, Gotlob said he thinks it’ll be years before the Trump real estate empire feels the effects due to the pause of the ruling, pending appeals. Even if the ruling takes effect, Trump could find ways around it — for instance by running shell companies, the lawyer opined. Still, “the possibility to lose business licenses for, at a minimum of five or even more years, that’s pretty damaging,” Gotlob said. “New York is like the epicenter of the business world.” The real estate tycoon is a defendant alongside his two eldest sons, the Trump Org and others in the case accusing Trump of pumping up the value of his assets on annual statements of financial condition from 2011 through 2021. Testimony at the trial lasted for 11 weeks and featured the former commander-in-chief, kids Eric, 39, Ivanka, 42, and Donald Jr., 45, all taking the witness stand. The former first daughter was also initially a defendant on the case until an appeals court dismissed her finding the claims against her were outside the statute of limitations. All four Trumps denied the AG’s claims and blamed any discrepancies on the financial documents on accountants and lawyers. Trump was in court for eight days of the trial — which he was not required to attend like he would be in a criminal case — and repeatedly attacked the AG and the case, as well as the judge and even Engoron’s top law clerk. Engoron issued a limited gag order on the second day of trial barring Trump from publicly speaking about his court staff when the 45th president went after the judge’s chief clerk Allison Greenfield on social media. The judge has fined Trump for $15,000 finding he twice violated the gag order.",https://nypost.com/2024/01/01/news/trump-faces-250m-penalty-business-ban-in-ny-upon-verdict/,https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/newspress-collage-0a0j94m4s-1702670777014.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1702654026&w=1200,2024-01-01 13:15:54,Priscilla DeGregory,['Priscilla DeGregory'],en,us,-0.602
175582213,Founder of Fermanagh distillery says demand for Irish spirits has ‘exploded’,"The founder of Fermanagh’s first legal gin distillery in more than 100 years, which is now exporting to over 15 countries, said there has been an “explosion” in global demand for Irish spirits. The Boatyard Distillery, situated on the banks of Lough Erne, is Fermanagh’s first legal distillery since 1890. The distillery, specialising in gin, was founded by Joe McGirr who grew up on a farm near the current site. Mr McGirr said he “fell in love” with the gin-making process while working in Edinburgh and fought hard to create a distillery in his home town.

You can arrive by boat, or by car, right to the distillery door, and I don’t know of any other distillery in Scotland or elsewhere, where you can actually do that, sort of right to the door. “So the place is very unique and very special, and you just can’t recreate that anywhere else.” Mr McGirr said the distillery utilises local produce to create a flavour profile distinct to Northern Ireland. “We set about trying to source organic based product, and we’re using organic wheat from a farmer in Monaghan and he grows us wheat, which sounds like a normal crop, but the amount of love that he’s got. And it’s in Monaghan so not that far from us,” he said. “He grows his wheat on north-facing hills, they’re actually hard to harvest so they’re quite steeply sloped. That gives lots of drainage. “It’s organic farming, so it’s a very much ‘shut the gate and see what happens’, no fertilisers or any separate chemicals going on there.” He added: “What are the key base products for our spirits are really important and that follows through, it wouldn’t be the same if we couldn’t get that. Being less than an hour away is really important for us.” Mr McGirr said despite the influx of bespoke products to the whiskey and gin markets, the character of Irish spirits is unique to the market. “I think there is an explosion in Ireland, both sides of the border at the minute towards Irish spirits, and how good they can be and that diversity that we’ve got at the minute in Irish spirits is incredible,” he said. “And you add into that the we’ve got this amazing thing called the distillery trail in Northern Ireland, which you can come and visit lots and lots of different distilleries, and you’d get a little card, we call it a passport, where you get stamped and that encourages people to kind of move around them and get different experiences, meet different people. “It is about the people, I think with all of the distilleries in a world where there’s a lot of whiskey and gin distilleries but each one is individually different. They look and feel different. And the people are very different and I think that’s the takeaway. Collectively I feel like we’ve got something very special to bring to the world.” The global popularity of Irish spirits have seen the Fermanagh distilled gin increase in popularity across the world. “We do really well, and this one amazes me every time, in Seoul in South Korea,” Mr McGirr said. “So we’ve got a lot of bars, like four seasons, we’ve got some amazing bars over there, and they love it. And when you see it being poured over there, and the passion that they’ve got, like they own it, that is just amazing. “I haven’t been lucky enough to get to go there for a martini, yet, touch wood, but that day is coming. “We’ve been in New York quite a few times and that’s always amazing when you see, and maybe it’s an ego thing as well, when you walk into a bar in New York, and someone orders a Boatyard next to you and you’re like, this is amazing.” The Boatyard distillery is the only distillery on the island of Ireland to be B Corp certified, a certification that measures accountability, transparency and sustainability.

175568869,Air safety 2023: Accidents and fatalities at record low,"Commercial aviation was safer in 2023 than in any previous year. According to a leading air safety expert, last year set a new record for the fewest accidents and deaths. Only two fatal accidents occurred during the 12 months, compared with six in 2022. In both crashes, propeller aircraft came down on domestic flights, with a total of 86 deaths – fewer than half the 178 fatalities in 2023. For comparison, 148 people die in the average hour on the world’s roads according to the latest UN figures. No fatal aircraft accidents involved international flights or passenger jets. In a civil aviation safety review for the Dutch air-safety organisation To70, senior aviation consultant Adrian Young writes: “Both the number of accidents and fatalities are at a record low.” The fatal accident rate was less than one in 15 million flights – three times better than the 10-year average. The first and deadliest crash was in Nepal on 15 January 2023. An ATR-72 belonging to Yeti Airlines took off and flew normally from Kathmandu to Pokhara, but plunged into a gorge one mile short of the runway. The subsequent investigation found that high workload and stress on the flight deck was responsible. Mr Young says the accident report revealed the pilots’ actions resulted in “the feathering of both propellers and subsequent loss of thrust, leading to an aerodynamic stall”. The second fatal accident was in Brazil on 16 September 2023, when an Embraer 110 belonging to Manaus Airlines crashed on a flight from the Amazonian city to Barcelos during bad weather. All 14 passengers and crew died. The safety of jet aircraft repeats the unlikely success of 2017, according to Mr Young. “As the new year dawns and we look back across 2023, civil aviation finds itself in a similar position to 2017 with no fatal accidents to large turbofan powered, passenger aeroplanes in commercial service,” he writes. This category encompasses everything from commuter jets of the type used at London City airport to the Airbus A380 “SuperJumbo”. The notorious crash of a private jet carrying the boss of Russia’s Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is excluded. The plane crashed with the loss of all 10 on board on 23 August 2023 during a flight from Moscow to St Petersburg. Reports claim an ally of Vladimir Putin was responsible for placing a bomb on the Embraer 135 aircraft. International law requires countries to involve the nation where the plane was made, in this case Brazil. But Russia refused to involve the Brazilian authorities or the aircraft manufacturer in the investigation. Mr Young describes this as “an unwelcome step that goes against the collaborative nature of accident investigation and does not help with the main reason to investigate accidents; the learning of lessons”. The safety expert warns of “a number of incidents and non-fatal accidents that require the industry to remain vigilant”. He writes: “Regardless of how low the accident rate in 2023 has been, there is no cause for complacency. “Aviation remains a risk-laden industry and as airports around the world report that movements are reaching the same level as in 2019, before the Covid 19 crisis, a number of issues have not gone away. “Serious injuries due to turbulence remain an ever-present factor in the year’s accidents.” Eleven passengers aboard a charter flight from Barbados to Manchester were hurt when their Airbus A330 encountered clear air turbulence over the Atlantic. The plane diverted to Bermuda on Christmas Eve. This year will see the 10th anniversary of the two tragedies involving Boeing 777 aircraft belonging to Malaysia Airlines. On 8 March 2014, flight MH370 disappeared while on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The jet is presumed to have come down in the Indian Ocean west of Australia. No trace has been found of the 227 passengers and 12 crew. On 17 July 2014, flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was downed by a Russian missile fired from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine. All 298 passengers and crew perished.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/air-safety-accidents-record-low-2023-b2471757.html,https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/01/17/07/newFile.jpg?width=1200,2024-01-01 13:19:39,Simon Calder,['Simon Calder'],en,gb,-0.311

175570251,Scots mental health experts share important New Year advice to help people struggling with low mood,"The hustle and bustle of Christmas is over and we're about to enter a brand new year, which can be a really exciting thing for a lot of people. But for many, the mental health slump that often happens after the holidays can leave you feeling helpless and wondering how to improve your wellbeing in the New Year. This dip in mood can be down to a number of different reasons - for example, a crash in energy after the excitement of the festive period. Whether you celebrated Christmas or not, spent the day working, with loved ones, or alone, anyone can feel down during this time of year. That’s why it’s more important than ever to make some time for self-care to try to protect our mental health. With this in mind, mental health experts at Scottish Action for Mental Health (SAMH) have put together a list of five things that you can do if you ever feel down. Connect with loved ones It can be easy to assume that everyone is busy seeing friends and family over this time, but if you’re feeling a bit lonely, it’s unlikely you’re the only one. To combat this, reach out to friends and suggest meeting up or having a chat over the phone. Technology can be a great asset here – there are lots of online games or activities you can do with others, even if they aren’t nearby. Or if you prefer the traditional approach, you can even write to someone who you haven't been in touch with for a while. Be active This one can be tough at this time of year, especially due to the unpredictable weather. But if you can, getting out for some fresh air and a walk really can do wonders for our mental health. And if not, you can try some yoga or gentle stretching indoors. There are plenty of options to give you ideas for a simple home workout on YouTube. Even a bit of light housework can get you moving and make you feel good about yourself. Take notice Slowing down and taking time to appreciate the small things is so important. As we come to end of the year, why not make a list of your favourite moments from the past 12 months, or reflect on what you’ve achieved? It doesn’t need to be anything big - maybe you’ve taken a step towards achieving a goal, or finally done something you had been putting off. When you’re out of the house, try to check in with all of your senses, one at a time, making a mental note of what can you see, smell, taste, touch, and hear. Meditation can also be a useful way to stop and mindfully take notice of how your body feels. Learn something new You’re never too old to learn something new, and there are lots of options that allow you to do this from the comfort of your sofa. Check out an interesting documentary you’ve been meaning to watch, or learn a new craft, like knitting or origami. You can also use this time to set a learning intention for the year by signing up to a new class or researching something you would like to learn next year. As well as this, there’s plenty of free learning opportunities out there that you can kickstart straight away. Give something back Giving feels good, and sometimes it can give us that all important little boost that we need. If you find yourself with some extra time at this time of year, consider volunteering in your local community There are lots of ways you can help out, and some of these can be done online if that suits you better. You can check out Volunteer Scotland for more options. You could also have a clear-out of things you don’t need any more and give them in to charity, or do a favour for a neighbour or friend. While the five ways to better wellbeing can be a helpful for some, if you find that you’re really struggling over this period, do reach out for help.

175576493,"More Big Companies Set to Collapse in 2024, Industry Experts Warn","More big firms are likely to go bust next year amid the “double whammy” of high borrowing costs and pressure on consumer budgets, according to insolvency experts. Administrators and restructuring specialists also warned the PA news agency that high-growth companies such as tech firms could be among those facing financial turbulence. It comes after another year of tough economic conditions resulted in increased business failures during the year. Official figures from the Insolvency Service earlier this month showed the total of company failures over the first 11 months of 2023 was more than reported during the entirety of 2022. PwC’s head of insolvency David Kelly said both the construction sector and business services industries each saw almost a fifth of total insolvencies. He said he therefore expects these areas to “remain the hardest hit in 2024.” Hospitality and retail have also contributed to business failures as they have been impacted by higher energy prices, pressure on consumer finances and borrowing costs. Around 17 percent of all insolvencies have come from the hospitality sector and 14 percent have come from retailers. This included high-profile failures such as the administration of Wilko, which had operated 400 shops and employed more than 12,000 workers. Paperchase, Planet Organic and Le Pain Quotidien were also among those to enter insolvency during 2023. Rob Hornby, partner and managing director of AlixPartners, said he expects company insolvencies to continue apace in 2024. “We are expecting next year to be a big year for insolvency,” he said. “That is likely to be across the board, both in terms of geographies and sectors.” The director at the restructuring and advisory specialist said typically high-growth areas, such as technology, could see turbulence as financing comes under increased pressure. Mr. Hornby said: “I personally think we are definitely seeing an element of the dotcom bubble repeating itself. “Since before the pandemic, there was plenty of investment money around, with VCs (venture capitals) worried about missing out. “You ended up with some areas of tech, for example, where you had more competitors funded in one space than were ever likely to succeed sustainably in the longer term. “Now some of that funding is running dry, you will start to see consequences.” Mr. Hornby and Richard Fleming, managing director and head of restructuring for Europe, at Alvarez & Marsal, both said they expected more firms to use restructuring plans this year in an effort to avoid full administrations. Nevertheless, Mr. Fleming said there was potential for some large failures next year as those with large debt burdens face particular pressure due high-interest rates. “We are expecting a similar level of insolvencies overall in 2024, but we should see an increased number of larger cases,” he said. “The impact of higher interest rates will increasingly be felt by companies who need to service their debt and by households on their mortgage payments. “Therefore, we’re expecting a double-whammy impact on companies across the UK, with a slowdown in consumer demand and higher borrowing costs, all putting stress on margins.”",https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/more-big-companies-set-to-collapse-in-2024-industry-experts-warn-5556262,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/10/17/id5511701-GettyImages-1310127935-300x180.jpg,2024-01-01 13:21:20,PA Media,['PA Media'],en,us,-0.255
175569859,Guinea junta plans referendum for new constitution,"The head of Guinea’s ruling junta says a constitutional referendum will be held in 2024, a key step towards the return of civilian rule after seizing power in a coup. Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, who has ruled since overthrowing the country’s first democratically elected president in 2021, announced the vote during an end-of-year speech late Sunday. He gave no date for the referendum. “In the new year, a new constitution which resembles us and brings us together will be submitted to a referendum,” Doumbouya said. He promised a constitution “approved by the people and which is not a copy and paste but a constitution, which draws inspiration from the past to together build our future”. Doumbouya also said that people appointed by the state will soon be named to lead municipal councils, which were elected in 2018 and whose mandates end in the first few months of the year. Nearly all the councils are currently headed by officials from parties of the ousted civilian ex-president Alpha Conde or former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo which are critical of the military leadership. Doumbouya said the announcements were due to a wish to “continue the considerable efforts to return to constitutional order through the organisation of free, democratic and transparent elections” respecting the timetable for a transition back to civilian rule. Conde took office in 2010 after decades of authoritarian rule. But he came under increasing fire after pushing through a constitutional reform that critics had argued was designed to allow him to run for a third term. After taking power, Doumbouya, under international pressure, promised to hand the reins of government back to elected civilians by January 2026. The September 2021 coup is among a string of putscheas and attempted coups in West Africa since 2020.

175572793,Medical teams in Gaza Strip exhausted dealing with large numbers of patients&#039; injuries: Doctor,"A British doctor of Palestinian origin said medical teams in the Gaza Strip are exhausted, dealing with large numbers of patients, Anadolu Agency reports. “The medical staff (at the European Gaza Hospital in the city of Khan Younis) is very exhausted, and the emergency department always receives patients with difficult and complex cases,” Basil Badir, an orthopaedic specialist from the team IDEALS, affiliated with the Islamic Aid charity organisation in the UK, told Anadolu in an exclusive interview. Badir, who arrived in the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on 25 December with four doctors, stressed that health teams in Gaza are exhausted, especially those working in hospital emergency departments. He said the role of the British medical team is to “try to alleviate the suffering of their colleagues working in the medical field in Gaza, even if only in a small way.” Describing doctors in the Gaza Strip as “real heroes,” Badir noted that patients transferred from the northern Gaza Strip to its southern part due to incomplete treatments face difficult health complications. “Before the hospitals in the north of Gaza were closed, many patients who had received partial treatment were forcibly sent to the southern part. These individuals are experiencing serious health problems due to the incomplete treatment,” he added. READ: 150 Palestinians killed, 286 injured as Israeli forces continue onslaught on Gaza: Health Ministry Emphasizing the challenging health situation at the European Gaza Hospital, where there are at least 900 patients and injured people, Badir said this number is twice the normal capacity during regular times. He said his accompanying health team has been visiting the Gaza Strip periodically for about 13 years, around eight to nine times a year, focusing on surgical areas. Last Sunday, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the destruction of the health system in the Gaza Strip as a “tragedy” on X. At least 150 Palestinians were killed and another 286 wounded in the past 24 hours as Israeli forces continued their onslaught in the besieged Gaza Strip, the Health Ministry in the blockaded enclave said Sunday. The Palestinian death toll from the Israeli army’s ongoing attacks on Gaza since 7 October has risen to 21,822, with 56,451 wounded, the ministry said. Authorities claim the Hamas attacks have killed around 1,200 Israelis. The Israeli onslaught has left Gaza in ruins, with 60% of the enclave’s infrastructure damaged or destroyed and nearly 2 million residents displaced amid acute shortages of food, clean water and medicines.",https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240101-medical-teams-in-gaza-strip-exhausted-dealing-with-large-numbers-of-patients-injuries-doctor/,https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AA-20231231-33323898-33323896-ISRAELI_ATTACKS_ON_GAZA_CONTINUE-scaled-e1704104854743.jpg,2024-01-01 13:25:50,"Middle East Monitor, sandi","['Middle East Monitor', 'sandi']",en,gb,0.008
175571475,Urgent plans to stop homeless people being separated from pets over fears for mental health,"Urgent moves are being made to stop people who are made homeless being forcibly separated from their pets. The explosion in Scottish homelessness has meant a generation of people in temporary homes and hotels - most of which forbid cats. dogs and other pets. The removal of animals from people in crisis has caused a parallel risk of mental health breakdown in highly vulnerable people. And some have chosen to sleep on streets rather than lose their pets. The Scottish SPCA charity has now formed an alliance with homelessness counterparts at the Simon Community, with both seeking to work with landlords to open pathways for pet owners to stay with cats, dogs and other pets. Scottish SPCA chief executive Kirsteen Campbell said, “Our research shows that 37% of tenants surveyed had to make the impossible choice between a roof over their head and a beloved pet. It’s a choice nobody should have to make.” “We want to work together and intervene early, to keep pets and people together in a home and not see them end up on the streets."" She added: “Our two frontline teams will share knowledge and resources so we can spot the signs when someone is at risk of becoming homeless or identify someone who has pets and is struggling. “This will allow us to get ahead of the problem before an animal, or person, suffers.” “We don’t believe that anyone should have to choose between a pet and a home and, working with Simon Community Scotland, we can make that vision a reality.” Hugh Hill, deputy CEO of Simon Community Scotland said: “We know that owning a pet has a hugely positive effect on your mental health and can be a huge source of comfort and security at a time food, energy and housing costs put pressure on the most vulnerable people in our society. “We are excited to be working with the Scottish SPCA to support people to have a safe place to live and help them and their pets stay together particularly as it is often their only source of companionship, comfort, purpose and physical contact.” Scottish Government figures show there were over 35,000 homeless applications in 2021/22 in Scotland, with 130,000 households (including 60,000 children) on waiting lists for social housing. More than 14,000 individuals and families were in temporary accommodation, with an average stay time of over 200 days. Building rates have fallen well behind target, with rising costs making the aim of building 110,000 affordable homes by 2032 totally unrealistic. Join the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. A 2022 survey by the Scottish SPCA showed 70% of people would risk becoming homeless if it meant they could stay with their pet. The two charities plan to run workshops for their people to allow their respective teams to more confidently identify issues around animal welfare and housing. The Scottish SPCA has also added Simon Community Scotland to their animal helpline system to enable the team to track referrals. Simon Community Scotland plan to do the same with their systems so the partnership can build a picture of how each organisation is working with each other and assess the demand between the two services. Anyone who is in need of advice or support can call the Scottish SPCA’s free animal helpline in confidence on 03000 999 999 or call Simon Community Scotland’s helplines on Edinburgh: 0808 178 2323 or Glasgow: 0800 027 7466.",https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/urgent-plans-stop-homeless-people-31621730,https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article31621799.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS280874836-1.jpg,2024-01-01 13:25:51,Mark McGivern,['Mark McGivern'],en,gb,-0.364
175601613,Israel to pull some troops from Gaza as war against Hamas enters new phase,"Israel is withdrawing some forces from Gaza to shift to more targeted operations against Hamas, and is partially returning reservists to civilian life to help the economy as the war looks set to last well into the new year, an Israeli official said. The official said toppling the Islamist faction remained an objective of the offensive in the Palestinian enclave, and that some of the five brigades withdrawn will prepare for a possible flareup of a second front against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Since launching the war in retaliation for the cross-border Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, Israeli officials have said they would wage it in three main stages. The first was intense shelling to clear access routes for ground forces and encourage civilians to evacuate. The second was the invasion that began on Oct. 27. With tanks and troops having now overrun much of the Gaza Strip, largely asserting control despite Palestinian gunmen continuing their ambushes from hidden tunnels and bunkers, the military is moving to the third stage, said the official, who could not be named in print given the sensitivity of the issue. ""This will take six months at least, and involve intense mopping-up missions against the terrorists. No one is talking about doves of peace being flown from Shajaia,"" the official told Reuters, referring to a Gaza district ravaged by fighting. In addition to the 1,200 people killed on Oct. 7, Hamas took some 240 hostage. Israel is also determined to recover the 129 still held in Gaza. Qatari- and Egyptian-mediated truce efforts have raised the prospect of some of them being freed. The shift appeared to correspond to pressure from Israel's top ally, the United States, to review tactics and do more to protect non-combatants. Some troops to move closer to Lebanon Israel initially drafted 300,000 reservists — some 10 to 15 per cent of its workforce — for what looks set to be its longest-ever war. Government sources have said between 200,000 and 250,000 reservists were still mobilized and absent from jobs or studies. The official said two of the brigades being withdrawn were made up of reservists, and described the move as designed to ""re-energize the Israeli economy."" Local media have reported that several military divisions were deployed throughout Gaza. The official added that some of the troops pulled out of Gaza in the south would be prepared for rotation to the northern border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. Next 6 months critical, official says Israel has warned that, if Hezbollah does not back down, a full-on Lebanon war looms. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range attacks against Israel. ""The situation on the Lebanese front will not be allowed to continue. This coming six-month period is a critical moment,"" the official said, adding that Israel would convey a similar message to a U.S. envoy conducting shuttle missions to Beirut. In Gaza, the Israel-Hamas war has inflicted unprecedented devastation, with the health ministry reporting almost 22,000 fatalities, many of them civilian. Israel says it has killed more than 8,000 Palestinian fighters — suggesting that, by its own accounting, Hamas retains core personnel. Pre-war Israeli assessment were that the group had around 30,000 fighters. The Israeli military announced on Saturday it was sending some reservists home as part of what top commander Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi has deemed a ""reconfiguration"" of forces. ""From the first moments of this war, we said it would take long,"" Halevi told troops on Tuesday. ""Will we ultimately be able to say there are no more foes around the State of Israel? I think that is overly ambitious. But we will deliver a different security situation — safe and, as much as possible, stable too."" Israel has listed 174 soldiers — many of them reservists — as killed in Gaza fighting and nine on the Lebanese border.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-hamas-war-day-87-1.7072063?cmp=rss,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7072064.1704110725!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/israel-palestinians-gaza.JPG,2024-01-01 13:26:50,Thomson Reuters,['Thomson Reuters'],en,ca,-0.382
175570131,Kimberly Palmer: Overspent in December? Here’s how to battle the January blues,"The first workday in January after the holidays hits a little bit differently: The parties are over, debt payments are soon due and it can feel like there’s nothing to look forward to. You may be able to minimize the doldrums with some planning and other steps to turn things around, financial experts say. “Financial stress can be temporary,” says Tonya Rapley, financial educator and founder of the millennial money and lifestyle blog My Fab Finance. She suggests focusing on small steps such as paying this month’s bills, then reminding yourself that you can recover from December’s overspending. Here are a few more ways to fight this month’s financial downers: MAKE OR UPDATE A BUDGET The new year is a great time to create or update a budget, which can give you back a sense of control, says Mike Croxson, CEO of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a nonprofit financial coaching organization. The popular 50/30/20 budget, for example, suggests putting 50% of your take-home income toward needs, 30% toward wants and 20% toward savings and any debt payments. You can adjust those percentages as needed, especially if you live in an urban area with high housing costs. “The best way to get control back is to make a plan,” Croxson says. “You can get back on top of this and back to where you feel good about your finances.” PAY OFF DEBT With interest rates higher than they were a couple of years ago, credit card debt is also more expensive, which makes paying it off a financial priority. How exactly you do that is up to you, Croxson says. “Paying off the highest interest rate balance first makes the most common sense, but for some people, paying off the smallest dollar amount first is most important because they feel like they accomplished something,” Croxson says. Small wins can give you momentum to continue. Online calculators for those two methods, known as the avalanche and the snowball, respectively, can help you stay on track. TRACK YOUR PAYMENTS CAREFULLY If you purchased holiday gifts using “buy now, pay later,” which allows shoppers to split payments into multiple installments, then it’s important to note when those bills are due, says Christine Alemany, chief marketing officer for i2c, a global banking and payments platform. Alemany suggests tracking your buy now, pay later due dates with a financial management tool or spreadsheet to avoid late fees or interest charges. “The variety of payment methods that consumers now have gives them the option to choose what’s best for them,” she says, but “that convenience needs to be balanced by discipline.” BUILD UP SAVINGS Amid all of that repayment, it’s also important to find a way to save money, Croxson says. “Having a savings line item in your budget is a critical step for virtually every consumer, even if it’s $20 or $25 a month,” he says. “There will be an emergency, and you will need it.” Being able to turn to savings in the future also helps you avoid building up debt again, he adds. The good news for Americans is that positive signs in the economy, such as a slower rate of inflation and lower gas prices, means it’s a little easier to find room for savings, according to Alan Gin, associate professor of economics at the University of San Diego’s Knauss School of Business. With gas prices coming down, Gin says, “not only will consumers be more confident, but they will have more money.” KNOW YOUR RIGHTS If an expensive item you bought or received as a gift in December breaks in January, that’s another potential downer, which is why knowing your refund rights is critical, says Wayne Hassay, partner attorney for LegalShield, a legal services provider. He suggests keeping track of all paperwork related to the item and any warranty attached whenever you make a big-ticket purchase. In some cases, paying with a credit card can give you additional protections, he adds. And if your pricey new electronics break, don’t hesitate to follow up with the retailer or brand until you get a satisfactory response, which could be a refund or a new product. GET HELP IF YOU NEED IT Working to pay off debt and get back on budget in January can feel lonely because it’s such a solo activity, which is why it’s helpful to reach out for additional support, whether that’s from financial professionals or friends and family. “Be honest with people,” Rapley says. She suggests sharing in a friend group chat if you are looking to scale back and spend less, because you’ll likely find encouragement that can help you stay on track. “That communication is definitely important,” she says, and can help you feel less alone — and with more good things to anticipate in the year ahead. ______________________ This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

175570133,&#8216;Unimaginable excess&#8217;: Bid to attract showy superyachts to Cape Breton under scrutiny,"HALIFAX — Not so long ago, the largest community in Cape Breton was best known as home to one of the most toxic waste sites in North America: the infamous Sydney tar ponds. Containing one million tonnes of oozing sewage and industrial sludge — left behind after centuries of steelmaking — the site has since been capped with concrete and transformed into a sprawling urban park that opened 10 years ago. “It’s a transformation from what was an industrial economy to one that is more service-based with tech businesses and education, ” says Terry Smith, CEO of Destination Cape Breton, the island’s tourism marketing organization. With memories of the tar ponds receding, the port city is now trying to cultivate an upscale vibe — one that includes appealing to billionaires and their toys. It wants to become a destination for superyachts, the most expensive, luxurious boats in the world, which have become the ultimate status symbol for A-list celebrities, dot-com titans and lesser-known oligarchs. Destination Cape Breton has hired Superyacht East Coast, based in Halifax, to attract to the island those who own boats like Archimedes, a 68-metre superyacht believed to be worth about $100 million. According to Superyachts.com, the vessel — as long as a 20-storey building is tall — has a marble Jacuzzi, a grand piano, an enclosed gym, a wood-burning fireplace and six staterooms. Compared to some superyachts, which boast helicopter hangars and glass elevators, Archimedes is considered an understated boat. Owned by U.S. hedge fund billionaire James Simons, the vessel spent at least a week last summer in Cape Breton, moored at the community wharf in Baddeck, N.S., where it caused quite a stir among the locals. “The larger yachts are the ones that people tend to gravitate to,” said Adam Langley, president and CEO of Superyacht East Coast. “They come alongside, and suddenly there’s hundreds of people around buying ice cream or lunch and taking in the environment that these boats create.” And the economic benefits don’t end there, Langley said. The owners of these floating mansions typically spend a small fortune on provisions after they arrive in port. Once Archimedes had completed its eight-week tour of Canada’s East Coast, the captain told Saltscapes magazine that its owner had spent US$400,000 on fuel, groceries, tours, guides and entertainment. “Think of them as large, floating resorts,” Langley said in a recent interview. “They’ll spend thousands of dollars on things like flowers.” But Tom Urbaniak says there needs to be a broader discussion about using public funds to attract superyachts to the East Coast. “What this is really about is marketing to an infinitesimally small group of oligarchs, the uber-rich, hyper-celebrities and the people who swoon around them,” said Urbaniak, professor of political science and director of the Tompkins Institute at Cape Breton University in Sydney. “This is not just a celebration of wealth. This is a celebration of almost unimaginable excess.” The professor says that at a time when Canadians are being asked to make sacrifices to deal with climate change, it doesn’t make sense to cater to rich people who flaunt their wealth in vessels that leave a massive carbon footprint. “I haven’t seen anything from Destination Cape Breton that there will be some kind of standard set to determine which ones get welcomed based on whether they pay taxes …. and whether they subscribe to the rule of law,” Urbaniak said. Smith says attracting superyachts is a small part of a broader strategy aimed at getting more boaters to come to the region. And he challenged the argument that superyacht owners represent the worst kind of polluters. “I don’t agree with that,” said Smith, whose non-profit organization gets most of its budget from a levy charged to those who pay for accommodations in Cape Breton, as well the provincial and federal governments. “There are electric superyachts now. I think we’re going to see a transformation in them in terms of cleaner fuels and cleaner ways of operating.” As for courting oligarchs, Langley says they’re not coming to Atlantic Canada anyway. “We see more explorer yachts that are not the huge, 600- and 400-foot superyachts,” he said, adding that superyacht builders are now keen on using hydrogen technology to propel their boats. “These are usually 200 feet and less, and they’re usually owned by people who are very sensitive to where they are going and operated by captains who are respectful (of the environment).” Meanwhile, Langley says he’s working on a marine tourism strategy for Nova Scotia that will include sections on sustainability and best practices for marinas and waterfronts. “I am very sensitive to that,” he said. “I grew up in Nova Scotia along the Northumberland Strait and I’m lucky enough to have a place in Baddeck …. These places are very special.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 1, 2024.

175595179,Various dimensions of the conflict in the Red Sea,"By P.K.Balachandran/Ceylon Today Colombo, January 1: The sustained attacks on international merchant shipping in the Red Sea by the Houthis of Yemen in support of the Hamas in the Gaza war, have brought the Houthis and the issues they throw up, to the world’s centre stage. The issue around the Houthis has multiple dimensions. Firstly, there is the Shiite-Sunni conflict in Yemen involving Iran and Saudi Arabia. Secondly, there is the pan-Islamic conflict with the Western countries and Israel. And thirdly, there is the economic vulnerability of the world’s powers who depend on the Red Sea being a conflict-free pathway for trade. The Houthis’ attacks on merchant shipping in the Red Sea are a direct threat to the world powers’ basic interest, which is a smooth flow of world trade. Major merchant shipping lines are now avoiding the Red Sea and are going around Africa. This will cause a rise in the cost of freight, a rise in prices at the consumers’ end, and delays in delivery. And last but not the least, the conflict in the Red Sea will divert the West’s attention (and consequently the world’s attention) from the Gaza conflict. That conflict, which has already taken 20,000 Palestinian lives, seems fated to continue indefinitely with both sides wanting to fight to the finish. Importance of Red Sea According to Al Jazeera, 12% of world trade; 12% of oil trade; and 8% of CNG trade pass through the Red Sea. And 8.8 million barrels of oil and 4.1 million cubic feet of LNG traverse it per day. The United States has formed a 20-nation international force under a project entitled “Operation Prosperity Guardian” to combat the Houthis. The Indian Navy deployed Guided Missile Destroyers INS Mormugao, INS Kochi and INS Kolkata, and also long-range maritime reconnaissance P8I aircraft in the area after the merchant vessel MV Chem Pluto, with 21 Indian crew members, was struck by a drone about 217 nautical miles from Porbandar last Saturday. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince on Tuesday and the two leaders “agreed to work together for peace, security and stability” in the West Asia region. In a post on X, Modi said, “Held a good conversation with my Brother HRH Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud on the future of Strategic Partnership between India and Saudi Arabia. We exchanged views on the West Asia situation and shared concerns regarding terrorism, violence and the loss of civilian lives. Agreed to work together for peace, security and stability in the region.” A statement by the Indian Prime Minister’s Office added that the two leaders emphasised “the need for maintaining maritime security and the freedom of navigation.” Iran’s Role According to the Western powers, the Houthis, being Shiites, are a proxy of Shiite Iran and that Iran has been supplying weapons to the Houthis to take on Israel and Arab nations like Saudi Arabia which are soft on Israel. But Iran has flatly denied the charge and insists that the Houthis are acting on their own accord. Nevertheless, the Houthis and Iran have common cause. One of them is to promote the Shiites vis-à-vis the Sunnis in the Islamic world’s power struggles. The other is that both have a deep grudge against the Americans, their allies in the Arab world and Israel. Apart from these, the Houthis have their own reasons to take on the US, Israel and the West in general. Yemeni Politics The Houthis’ raison d'etre is in the politics of Yemen essentially. The Houthi are a militant movement in northern Yemen. The movement was initiated by the , a Yemeni politician and political activist from the Zaydi sect of Shiite Islam. The objective of the Houthi movement is to promote Zaydi revivalism. The movement calls itself Anṣar Allah (“Defenders of God”) but is popularly known as the “Houthi movement” acknowledging the role of its founder, Hussein Badr al-Din al-Houthi. Since 2004 the Houthi movement has been in armed rebellion against Yemen’s internationally recognized government. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Zaydis have been one of Yemen’s main political constituencies. In 1962 the Imam of the Zaydis was overthrown and forced into exile. A military regime—the Yemen Arab Republic—was set up in place of the Imamate. This was met with fierce resistance from the Zaydis. The military regime kept thwarting the Zaydi elites’ political ambitions. In the 1970s there was an injection of Wahhabism (i.e., a Saudi Sunni sect) that undermined the core of the Zaydi doctrine and challenged the authority of Zaydi elites. In retaliation, the Shiite Zaydis embraced Shiite symbols, fostered by Iran, openly, creating tension with the Yemeni Wahhabis who were inspired by the Saudis. In 1990, the Yemen Arab Republic and the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen to its south were united. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, unification offered a political opening for Zaydis and the Zaydi elites formed the Al-Ḥaqq Party. But the Al Haqq party was in sharp conflict with the Wahhabist Al Iṣlaḥ (Reform) Party. The charismatic Al-Ḥaqq founder-leader, Hussein Badr al-Din al-Houthi, began fostering the “Believing Youth”, a network of Zaydi youths intended to challenge Wahhabi youth networks. The “Believing Youth” initially received support from Yemen’s government, but its growing popularity and its criticism of President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s government led to State aid being cut off in 2000. The conflict sharpened after President Saleh supported the US “War on Terror” in 2001 and the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Saleh regime began cracking down on the Al Haqq. During the armed resistance, the Al Haqq leader, Hussein Houthi, was killed by Yemeni government forces. The leadership of the movement of Al Haqq passed on to his brother Abdul Malik al Houthi. Al Haqq’s armed resistance to the Saleh government increased following popular dissatisfaction against it. After the Arab Spring protests in Tunisia and Egypt toppled their respective Presidents in early 2011, Yemenis called for the end of the Saleh regime. In November, Saleh signed an internationally mediated agreement to hand power to his Vice President, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. But Sleh was the power behind Hadi. The Hadi Presidency gave more importance to the Wahhabi Al Iṣlaḥ Party, to Al Haqq’s chagrin. In July 2014, Hadi’s administration cut fuel subsidies to address the widening budget deficit. Popular protests erupted. In September 2014, Yemeni security forces opened fire on protesters in the capital Sanaa, killing several. This escalated armed confrontation culminated in the Houthi takeover of parts of Sanaa. In late January 2015, Houthi fighters occupied the presidential palace, and Hadi was forced to resign. But the following month, Hadi emerged in Aden and retracted his resignation. He also secured international military intervention to drive back the Houthi rebels from Sanaa. A Saudi-led campaign against the Houthi rebels began in March 2015. Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia, where he set up a government in exile. The United Nations made efforts to mediate between the belligerents. But the negotiations failed. In late 2017, Saleh announced his readiness to engage in dialogue on the demands of the Saudi-led coalition. But the Houthis ousted Saleh’s forces from Sanaa and, on December 4, killed Saleh. The port city of Al-Ḥudaydah (Hodeidah) was the primary source of imports and revenue for the Houthi rebellion. In June 2018 the Saudi-led coalition advanced on Hodeidah. But, because the port was also a lifeline for humanitarian aid, the United Nations intervened and mediated a cease-fire that came into effect in December, the Encyclopaedia Britannia says. The Houthi rebels were presenting an increasingly formidable challenge for the Saudi-led coalition. Not only did they gain ground against the coalition in Yemen, but struck Saudi territory with drones and missiles. The Houthis claimed responsibility for an attack in September 2019 on the oil-processing facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia. The Western powers said that Iran’s clandestine “Quds Force” was responsible for the growing sophistication of Houthi attacks. But Iran refuted this allegation. Place of Gaza Crisis The Gaza crisis which began on October 7 added another reason for the Houthis’ conflict with Israel, the US and Saudi Arabia. The Houthis put the Shiite-Sunni conflict on the backburner and openly expressed support for the Hamas which is a Sunni organization. The Houthis’ struggle has many strands. They stand for the Zaydi community, Shiism, anti-Wahhabism, as well anti-Western imperialism, all in go. They seek to defeat Israel in Gaza. Their attacks against Western shipping in the Red Sea are an expression of the support to Hamas. The Houthis are likely to carry on this fight regardless of the opposition from the world’s powers. Most recently, the Houthis staged a drone attack on the Israeli pott of Eilat, directly challenging Israel. An end to the turmoil in the Middle East is therefore not in sight. On the contrary, exacerbation is on the cards.

175586561,Former LRA Rebels Seek Forgiveness and Reintegration in Uganda,"Former combatants of the notorious Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) have made a heartfelt plea to the Ugandan government and local communities in the Acholi sub-region, seeking forgiveness for the atrocities they were coerced into committing during their time with the rebel group. Representing the returnees, Doctor Acaye, one of 141 ex-LRA members repatriated from the Central African Republic (CAR), expressed deep remorse, highlighting their forced conscription and the harrowing experiences they endured. “We were forcefully abducted and compelled to do unimaginable things. We ask for forgiveness and want to return to our country, Uganda, as citizens who were tragically torn away from our families,” Acaye lamented. The returnees, comprising 35 men, one woman, 27 spouses, and 78 children, defected from Joseph Kony’s elusive LRA camp six years ago. They resided in Mboki and Zemio in southeastern CAR before their recent repatriation. Acaye emphasized their voluntary defection and the sincere desire to reintegrate into society as law-abiding citizens. Archbishop John Baptist Odama, leading a prayer for the returnees, conveyed the religious leaders’ message of absolution, urging them to shed their guilt and embrace a fresh start. Gulu LC V chairperson Christopher Opiyo Atekere highlighted the logistical challenges faced by the returnees, advocating for their seamless acquisition of national identification to be recognized as Ugandan citizens. He also appealed to the government for resettlement assistance, drawing parallels with the Bududa resettlement initiative, proposing land allocation and housing support for their smoother reintegration. State Minister for Northern Uganda, Grace Freedom Kwiyucwiny, commended the returnees for renouncing rebellion and emphasized ongoing efforts within the Ministry of Internal Affairs to accommodate individuals without parental identification in the national registration process. Brig. Gen Dr. Patrick Ocen, representing the ministry of Defence and Veteran Affairs, confirmed plans to issue certificates of amnesty to the ex-LRA combatants, signaling a step towards their legal reintegration into society. The returnees’ repatriation was facilitated by NGOs PAX and APRu, specializing in LRA defection in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo and CAR. These organizations pledged extensive support, including school fees, specialized meals, and medical care during the returnees’ rehabilitation in Gulu. As Uganda grapples with reconciling its past conflicts, the return of these former LRA fighters represents a poignant plea for forgiveness, reconciliation, and a second chance at rebuilding their lives within their homeland.

175571371,"‘Completely alienated’: British Muslims on Labour, Tory stance on Gaza war","London, United Kingdom — Visiting Tel Aviv in mid-October, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stood next to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, who had launched a devastating war on Gaza following the October 7 Hamas attacks on southern Israel. “We want you to win,” Sunak told Netanyahu before the cameras. More than two months later, the United Kingdom’s support for Israel’s war has remained largely unqualified, even as Israeli bombs and artillery firing have killed more than 21,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including more than 8,000 children. But whatever a “win” might look like for Israel, Sunak’s Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party, whose leader Keir Starmer has also backed Netanyahu’s war, have both lost voters like Ala Sirriyeh, a senior lecturer in sociology at Lancaster University. “It has shown very starkly who they are prepared to throw under the bus to get elected, whose welfare matters and whose does not,” she told Al Jazeera. “As a Palestinian, I feel completely alienated from the major political parties [in the UK] and will not be voting for either of them in the near future.” She is not alone. As Israel continues to bomb Palestinians in Gaza, a coalition of political groups, worker’s unions, students, healthcare professionals, journalists, writers, and common people from all walks of life have been organising in the UK, urging their political leadership to call for a ceasefire. The protesters, day in and day out have occupied public spaces and weapons factories and marched across city centres and university campuses. Thousands of people have signed petitions calling for a ceasefire. Yet, as leaders across both major parties have stayed firm in their support for Israel, they face a particular crisis of credibility among British Muslims, who constitute 6.7 percent of the population and traditionally largely vote in support of the Labour Party. “It is deeply distressing to see these calls for a ceasefire being ignored or shut down,” Sirriyeh said. In a survey involving 30,000 Muslim participants conducted in late October by the Muslim Census, an organisation based in the UK, only 5 percent of the respondents said they would vote for Labour in the next general elections. That is much lower compared with 71 percent of British Muslims who voted for the party in 2019. The Conservative Party, which drew 9 percent of the Muslim vote in 2019, would get less than 1 percent of the votes of those sampled in that survey. In another survey of 1,032 Muslims across the UK, more than two-thirds expressed dissatisfaction with the British government’s response to the Israeli assault on Gaza. Nearly half of the respondents conveyed similar sentiments regarding Starmer’s approach to the crisis, though a majority still backed the Labour Party. And it is not just Muslims in the UK. In a YouGov poll of overall public sentiments published on November 15, a third of the participants said the UK government should oppose Israel’s war and push for a ceasefire. Another quarter of those who participated called for a limited ceasefire. Only 9 percent opposed any kind of a ceasefire while backing Israel’s military aims. “I have seen the conversations, and perceptions, regarding this issue shift substantially in favour of Palestine,” Arooj, a schoolteacher in her 20s who has participated in protest rallies, told Al Jazeera. Arooj said she was not comfortable sharing her full name, at a time when many pro-Palestinian protesters have been targeted at their workplaces. Even a month after that survey, however, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron refused to back an immediate ceasefire, in an op-ed, written in collaboration with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock. “We do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is the way forward,” they wrote, blaming Hamas for the crisis. Starmer too has refused to back a full end to fighting in Gaza, instead calling for a “sustainable ceasefire”, a phrase that Tayib Ali, the director of the UK-based International Centre of Justice for Palestinians, termed a “weak and watered down call”. During a parliamentary vote on a ceasefire resolution, introduced by the Scottish Nationalist Party, Starmer threatened Labour members with expulsion if they voted in favour. Earlier, in a radio interview, the Labour leader backed Israel’s decision to withhold water and electricity from Gaza. Meanwhile, United Nations experts and leading human rights groups have warned that Israel is likely committing war crimes and that its actions might amount to genocide, as South Africa has alleged in a case before the International Court of Justice. Sirriyeh said she believes the Labour leadership’s reluctance to criticise Israel stems from fears that allegations of anti-Semitism might be weaponised against the party. “Given the critiques levied at the Labour Party during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership about the party’s failure to address alleged anti-Semitism within its ranks, there is a wariness among politicians for calling for a ceasefire and calling out Israeli war crimes,” she said. Starmer has faced a revolt from sections of his party over his stance. Imran Hussain, a front bench MP and shadow minister, in his resignation letter to Starmer, said a ceasefire was essential to ending the suffering of people in Gaza. Accusing Israel of inflicting war crimes and collective punishment, Hussain wrote, “The situation in Gaza is now beyond that of a humanitarian catastrophe.” Condemning Starmer’s support for Israel’s policy of withholding water and electricity from Gaza, at least 23 Labour councillors left the party. Shaista Aziz, one among them, wrote that the Labour leader had “horrifyingly endorsed the collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza”. But it is on the streets that Arooj sees the future of pro-Palestinian solidarity in the UK, in the form of young people — including schoolchildren — who have marched against the war. Polling shows that younger people in the UK lean significantly in support of Palestine. “The younger generation gives me hope,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/1/completely-alienated-british-muslims-on-labour-tory-stance-on-gaza-war?traffic_source=rss,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AP23329566763663-1704110108.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,2024-01-01 13:29:55,"Apps Support, Umar Lateef Misgar","['Apps Support', 'Umar Lateef Misgar']",en,qa,0.111

175572753,"Israel moving thousands of troops out of Gaza, but expects ""prolonged fighting"" with Hamas","Tel Aviv — Israel's military has begun moving thousands of troops out of the Gaza Strip, but officials stress that the Israel Defense Forces are set to continue waging a long war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The announcement of a redeployment came after Israel's prime minister said he saw the conflict continuing well into the new year.Thousands of Israeli soldiers were being shifted out of Gaza, however, military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters on Monday, in the first significant drawdown since the war was sparked by Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7 terror attack on southern Israel. In a statement, the IDF said five brigades, or several thousand troops, would be moved out of Gaza over the coming weeks for training and rest. In a briefing Sunday when he first announced the troop withdrawal, without specifying how many forces were leaving, Hagari did not say whether the decision meant Israel was launching a new phase of the war. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas' military and governing capabilities in Gaza, a small Palestinian territory which the group — long designated a terror organization by Israel and the U.S. — has ruled for almost two decades. Hamas' attack on Israel left about 1,200 people dead and saw the militants take some 240 people hostage. The troop movement could indicate a scaling back of Israel's war effort in some parts of densely populated Gaza, most likely in the northern half of the enclave where the IDF focused the initial phase of its offensive. Israel, a close U.S. ally in the heart of the tumultuous Middle East, has been under mounting pressure from the Biden administration to switch to lower-intensity fighting amid escalating death toll reports from Gaza, where Hamas officials say more than 20,000 people have been killed. But Hagari made it clear that Israel's war with Hamas was not yet over.""The objectives of the war require prolonged fighting, and we are preparing accordingly,"" he said.Nor is it over for Hamas, and as the clock struck midnight local time, it was sirens that rang in the new year across Israel on Monday morning. Hamas fired a barrage of rockets, lighting up the sky for revelers in Tel Aviv as Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of them. No injuries were reported.In Gaza, there was no happy new year. Thousands of Palestinians have spent weeks crammed into tents in the southern city of Rafah, huddling close to stay warm. Many in the camps lost a mother, father, husband, wife, brother, sister, child or grandchild in 2023, and they fear the new year will only bring more of the same. ""My tragedy lives inside me,"" said Kamal al-Zeinaty, one of the many displaced. ""The outside world does not feel it at all.

175582051,Israeli army says Gaza war will continue throughout 2024,"Israel warned its war against Hamas will continue throughout 2024 as unrelenting strikes killed two dozen people in Gaza and the Palestinian militant group fired a rocket barrage at the stroke of midnight. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a New Year's message that some of the 300,000 army reservists would get a break from the war, in order to prepare for the ""prolonged fighting"" ahead. The army ""must plan ahead, understanding that we will be required for additional tasks and warfare throughout this year,"" Hagari said as the conflict sparked by the October 7 Hamas attacks raged on. Heavy artillery fire again pounded targets in Hamas-run Gaza, killing at least 24 people, health ministry officials there said, with attacks reported across the length of the territory. In the besieged Gaza Strip, where the UN says 85 percent of the population has been displaced, 20-year-old Hamdan Abu Arab said he hoped ""2024 will be better"". ""We used to go out and enjoy our time on the last day of the year,"" he recalled. ""But this New Year's Eve, there are only missiles and the remains of people."" Hamas marked the start of the year by firing a rocket barrage at Israel in what it called a ""response to the massacres of civilians"". AFP journalists in Tel Aviv witnessed missile defence systems intercept rockets overhead as some revellers ran for cover and others kept up the party with a shrug. ""My heart was pounding,"" said one, Gabriel Zemelman, 26, shortly after the rocket fire. ""It's terrifying. You just saw the life we live, it's crazy."" The bloodiest ever Gaza war was triggered by Hamas' October 7 attacks in south Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. The militants also took around 250 people hostage that day, more than half of whom remain in Gaza, according to Israeli officials. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and launched a punishing offensive that has reduced vast areas of Gaza to a ruined wasteland and killed at least 21,822 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry. The Israeli army says 172 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza in the battle against the Islamist militant group which Israel, the United States and European Union have designated a ""terrorist"" organisation. - 'We live like animals' - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Saturday that the fighting would last ""many months until Hamas is eliminated and the hostages are returned"". Hagari said ""we are also currently adapting the planning of the force deployment in Gaza and the reserve system. Some of the reservists will return to their families and employment this week. ""This will significantly ease the burden on the economy and allow them to gather strength for the upcoming activities in the next year, as the fighting will continue and they will still be required."" Since Israel imposed a siege at the outset of the war, Gazans have been facing dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. UN chief Antonio Guterres has condemned the ""epic human suffering"" and ""collective punishment"" of Palestinian civilians, while the WHO has warned of the risk of hunger and infectious disease. ""We are exhausted... We were displaced five times during this war,"" said 29-year-old Bassam Hana. ""We hope things improve in 2024 and that we live just like any other human being. Currently, we live like animals."" At least 48 Palestinians were killed in strikes on Gaza City over the weekend, the territory's health ministry said, with many still buried under the rubble. ""After the explosion we arrived at the scene of the strike and saw martyrs everywhere,"" said one resident after a building was hit. ""Children are still missing, we can't find them."" Hagari, in a briefing on Sunday, said several militants ""were killed and subdued during the battles in Khan Yunis"", the main southern city, earlier in the day. ""We are continuing to handle the underground tunnels and to strike the rocket launching array, in order to reduce rocket fire into the State of Israel,"" he said, adding that ""dozens of aircrafts are in the skies of Gaza at any given moment"". - Regional fears - International mediators have continued efforts toward a new pause in fighting. A Hamas delegation from Qatar visited Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian three-phase plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the war, sources close to Hamas said. Their allies Islamic Jihad said on Saturday that Palestinian factions were evaluating the proposal and would give a response ""within days."" The war in Gaza has raised fears of a broader regional conflict, with hostilities flaring with mostly Iran-backed militant groups in nearby countries who say they are acting in support of Hamas. The Israeli army announced Sunday night having intercepted two ""hostile aircraft"" launched from Syria towards northern Israel. Earlier it had reported launches toward Israeli territory from Lebanon, where it has fought Hezbollah. ""Throughout the day, IDF (military) tanks and helicopters targeted three terrorist squads operating in Lebanon,"" the army said in a statement. And in the Red Sea, the U.S. military said Sunday that Navy helicopters had fired at Iran-backed Huthi rebel boats off Yemen that were attacking a cargo ship, with Yemeni sources reporting 10 rebels killed.",https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/302482-israeli-army-says-gaza-war-will-continue-throughout-2024,http://images2.naharnet.com/images/258685/w140.jpg?1704112405,2024-01-01 13:33:29,Naharnet Newsdesk,['Naharnet Newsdesk'],en,lb,0.194
175576961,"Bring Mary’s gratitude and hope into the new year, pope says - OSV News","VATICAN CITY (CNS) — On New Year’s Eve, believers and non-believers alike give thanks for all they have received in the last 12 months and express their hopes for the coming year, but Christians are called to cultivate their gratitude and hope following the example of Mary, Pope Francis said. “Faith enables us to live this hour in a way different than that of a worldly mindset,” the pope said during an evening prayer service in St. Peter’s Basilica Dec. 31. “Faith in Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, born of the Virgin Mary, gives a new way of feeling time and life.” Pope Francis said that while many people express thanks and hope on New Year’s Eve, in reality, they often “lack the essential dimension which is that of relationship with the Other and with others, with God and with brothers and sisters.” With a worldly mentality, gratitude and hope are “flattened onto the self, onto one’s interests,” he said. “They don’t go beyond satisfaction and optimism.” Pope Francis encouraged Christians to look to the example of Mary who, after giving birth to Jesus, had a mother’s gratitude in her heart for bearing the child of God. “Mystery makes room for gratitude, which surfaces in the contemplation of gift, in gratuitousness, while it suffocates in the anxiety of having and appearing,” the pope said. “The church learns gratitude from the Virgin Mary.” The pope also said that the hope of Mary and the church “is not optimism, it is something else: it is faith in a God faithful to his promises.” “This faith takes the form of hope in the dimension of time,” he said. “Christians, like Mary, are pilgrims of hope.” Near the basilica’s main altar was an icon of the “Madonna Lactans,” or Nursing Madonna, from the Benedictine Abbey of Montevirgine in Mercogliano, Italy. The icon, in late Byzantine style, shows Mary nursing the infant Jesus. The pope prayed silently before the image before leaving the basilica. The service culminated with the choir and the 6,500 people present in the basilica singing the “Te Deum” (“We praise you, oh God”) in thanksgiving for the blessings of the past year. In his homily, Pope Francis noted that the coming year would involve intense preparation for the Holy Year 2025. Yet more than worrying about organizing logistics and events, the pope asked people to be witnesses to “ethical and spiritual quality of coexistence.” As an example, he pointed out that people of every nationality, culture and religion come together in St. Peter’s Square, so the basilica must be welcoming to all people and provide accessible information. The pope then praised charm of Rome’s historic center but said it must also be accessible to people with disabilities and the elderly. Roberto Gualtieri, mayor of Rome, sat in the front of row of the basilica during the prayer service and greeted the pope at its conclusion. Pope Francis noted that a pilgrimage “requires good preparation,” and recalled that 2024 would be dedicated to prayer before the Holy Year. “And what better teacher could we have than our holy Mother?” the pope asked. “Let us learn from her to live every day, every moment, every occupation with our inner gaze turned to Jesus.” After the prayer service, the pope greeted people lined along the basilica’s central nave. Then, riding in his wheelchair, he went outside to pray in front of the Nativity scene in St. Peter’s Square, taking his time to wave to visitors, bless children and listen to the Swiss Guard band as it played Christmas carols.",https://www.osvnews.com/2024/01/01/bring-marys-gratitude-and-hope-into-the-new-year-pope-says/,https://www.osvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/123123_TeDeum-5-1024x576.jpg,2024-01-01 13:34:53,Justin McLellan,['Justin McLellan'],en,us,0.335

175576491,Ex-Cycling World Champion Dennis Reportedly Charged After Olympian Wife Killed by Vehicle,"ADELAIDE, Australia—Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis was reported to have been charged in connection with the death of his wife, Olympic cyclist Melissa Hoskins, who died after being struck by a vehicle while riding in Adelaide. Australian media reports said Mr. Dennis had been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, endangering life, and driving without due care. The reports said he had been released on bail to appear at the Adelaide Magistrates Court in March. Ms. Hoskins, 32, competed for Australia at the London and Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Police said emergency services were called to an address in Medindie, an Adelaide suburb, around 8 p.m. Saturday, following reports a woman had been struck by a vehicle. Police said the woman, later identified as Ms. Hoskins, suffered serious injuries and died after being taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Ms. Hoskins competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics on the track in the team pursuit and was in the squad that won the 2015 world title in the event. “Melissa described her team pursuit gold medal at the 2015 world championships as the highlight of her career but for the rest of us, the highlight was just having her around,” AusCyling chief executive Marne Fechner said in a statement Monday. “Although she retired in 2017, her presence as an alumnus of the sport has been felt and appreciated by many in the cycling and riding community.” Ms. Hoskins also competed in road cycling for several years with the Australian team GreenEDGE. The 33-year-old Mr. Dennis won two world titles in the road time trial, as well as silver in the team pursuit at the London Olympics and bronze in the road time trial at the Tokyo Olympics. He became the seventh Australian to wear the yellow jersey as race leader at the Tour de France by winning the opening time trial in 2015, setting a race record for his average speed. Mr. Dennis, who has retired from competitive cycling, was named Australian Cyclist of the year in 2015 and 2018 and won the 2015 Tour Down Under in his home city of Adelaide. After his retirement and their marriage in 2018, the Dennis family relocated to Adelaide from Europe. Ms. Hoskins and Mr. Dennis were this month scheduled to take part in an event at the Tour Down Under in Adelaide. “We are devastated by the news of Melissa Hoskins death. It’s an extremely tragic situation which has seen the loss of a young mum and champion cyclist,” Tour Down Under organizers said in a statement Monday. “Given the circumstances, Rohan Dennis will no longer be participating.”",https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/ex-cycling-world-champion-dennis-reportedly-charged-after-olympian-wife-killed-by-vehicle-5556248,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/01/01/id5556259-Rohan-Dennis-300x180.jpg,2024-01-01 13:37:20,The Associated Press,['The Associated Press'],en,us,0.05
175573681,Column: How does this Chicago Bears run defense match up with dominant teams of the past? The numbers don&#8217;t lie.,"There is a link between the 2023 Chicago Bears and past teams, including the division champions in 2018 and 2001 and even the Super Bowl XX champions of 1985. The run defense this season is every bit as good as it was for the dominant defenses of those successful teams. In fact, with two games remaining, Matt Eberflus’ team has a shot at being the best run defense in Bears history, a remarkable possibility when considering last year’s team ranked 31st in the NFL allowing 157.3 yards per game, the organization’s second-worst season in the Super Bowl era (161.4 yards per game in 2013). It’s the same scheme — a base Tampa Two defense that, historically can have a weakness against the run — with mostly the same coaches and many of the same players. General manager Ryan Poles wasn’t oblivious to the problem a year ago when five opponents rushed for 200 or more yards against the Bears. He responded by bucking up at the linebacker position and signing Tremaine Edmunds ($72 million, four years) and T.J. Edwards ($19.5 million, three years) and adding nose tackle Andrew Billings to a $2.75 million, one-year contract. The improvements have been striking. Entering Week 17, the Bears (6-9) are No. 1 in the NFL against the run, allowing 80.7 yards per game, nearly 77 yards better than last year’s defense. With games against the Atlanta Falcons (eighth in the league in rushing offense) and Green Bay Packers remaining, Eberflus’ team is in a position to rank with the best in club history. 2018: 80.0 yards per game 2023: 80.7 yards per game 2001: 82.1 yards per game 1985: 82.4 yards per game “Wow,” Edmunds said when presented with the statistics. “I didn’t know that. It would mean a lot.” Finding help at linebacker was an obvious goal for Poles after trading Roquan Smith last year. Adding Billings on a bargain deal proved shrewd and the former 3-4 nose tackle, slimmed down a little to 311 pounds for the scheme, already earned an $8 million, two-year extension. “They expected me to come in here and make an impact, to be that rock in the middle of the defense,” Billings said. “They wanted to improve the run D and they stressed that to me.” The run defense got even better with the Oct. 31 trade for end Montez Sweat, who has made an impact with six sacks and 13 quarterback hits in seven games. Sweat has been as advertised since arriving, as former Washington Commanders pro scout Donnie Warren said he was a tremendous two-way player — meaning he’s just as good defending the run as he is harassing quarterbacks. It’s eye-opening that the defense could be catapulted from near the bottom of the league to the top with four new players who have a combined total of two Pro Bowl selections — both by Edmunds. “It’s a want-to,” tackle Justin Jones said. “There is no secret recipe to it. You’ve got to want to beat the man in front of you. That’s kind of how I see it. We had a bunch of guys that take pride in that and then obviously bringing (Sweat) in, having him settling into our foundational stuff we do, obviously stop the run first, and then get the quarterback, it’s fun to see.” The Bears have started reaping the benefits that come with stopping the run on first and second down and putting opposing offenses behind the chains. They rank second in the NFL with 18 interceptions — only the San Francisco 49ers (19) have more. They’ve allowed 558 yards rushing on first-and-10, the second-lowest total in the league. They’ve become a good pass-rushing unit since Sweat arrived, with 17 sacks and 49 QB hits in seven games. “There are a lot of things, and I hate to get on the negative side, that we’re still trying to improve on,” Edmunds said. “I’m not going to neglect the fact that would mean a lot to us (to set a franchise record). It shows the hard work guys have put in. We’re not satisfied where we are and I think the main message now is to continue to get better. ” There are some basic metrics the Bears want to improve. They’re tied for 21st in scoring, allowing 21.0 points per game. The Bears are 12th in yardage (318.1), 29th on third down (43.8%), 32nd in the red zone (72.5%) and with the midseason start in getting after quarterbacks they’re 31st in sack rate (4.89%). At Halas Hall, the team has to believe that with some offseason moves and Sweat in place for the start of 2024, they will be better across the board. The Bears are tied for fourth in the league in explosive plays allowed, defined as 20 yards for a passing play and 10 for rushing plays, and that’s significant. Any more, defensive coaches are more concerned with eliminating big plays than they are with stopping the run. The Bears have excelled in both areas and the success against the run, assuming it can be carried into next season, suggests other improvements will follow. “First things first, to be a good defense you’ve got to stop the run,” said Edwards, who is seventh in the league with 141 tackles. “That’s really our goal and was a heavy point of emphasis coming into this year. It’s not always been perfect or anything like that. We’re not worried about the stats right now. We just want to play good team defense. That starts up front and that starts with how you defend the run and try to make opponents as one-dimensional as you can.” The ability to get an opponent behind the sticks is going to lead to more pass-rushing situations and with that, in theory, should come more opportunities for takeaways. The ability to stop the run without loading the box is also paramount because that can leave passing windows open on the back end. “Facts,” Jones said. Yes, the dominant run defenses the Bears have had in the past were all part of very successful teams in the franchise’s rich history. The current group has to look at this development as a steppingstone. “It’s cool,” Jones said. “You want to win more with it.” ()",https://www.twincities.com/2024/01/01/column-how-does-this-chicago-bears-run-defense-match-up-with-dominant-teams-of-the-past-the-numbers-dont-lie-2/,https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/202312290716TMS_____MNGTRPUB_SPORTS-COLUMN-HOW-DOES-THIS-CHICAGO-BEARS-3-TB5.jpg?w=1024,2024-01-01 13:38:00,Tribune News Service,['Tribune News Service'],en,us,0.153
175572901,"Attack on Manipur cops, search on to nab rebels: Team to apprise leaders in Delhi of situation","Imphal: The security forces Monday continued their search to nab the suspected Kuki militants, who attacked Manipur Police commandos Saturday and Sunday, injuring five personnel seriously. Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh also expressed concern over the attacks on the forces and said that a delegation would soon go to Delhi to apprise the central leaders on the prevailing situation in the state. A senior police officer said that additional security forces have been deployed in Moreh and adjoining areas in the state’s Tengnoupal district, along Myanmar, and the state and the central forces continued their combing operations to nab the suspected Kuki militants. The injured personnel — Diliangam Kamson, M Priyokumar, N Borjao, M Sunil, and Ponkhalung — were given first aid at the Assam Rifles camp in Moreh and then brought to Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal, the officer said. Several tribal organisations alleged that many houses of Kuki-Zo tribals were burnt down by the attackers in Moreh area since Saturday. The Manipur Chief Minister, posting his statement on X, said, “The unprecedented attacks against the state forces in the recent times have become a serious national security threat. While the state and central security forces are actively engaged in maintaining control over the situation, it is also imperative for the combined security forces to adopt a robust and comprehensive approach to deal with these elements, who are relentlessly attempting to destabilise the state of Manipur.” Singh added, “Joined a high-level meeting in presence of A Sharda Devi, President, BJP Manipur Pradesh, Hon’ble Ministers, Hon’ble MLAs, and party karyakartas to deliberate on a stringent approach to deal with elements who are hell-bent upon destabilising Manipur.” A delegation will also be going to Delhi soon to meet the central leaders in this regard, he added. Meanwhile, Manipur Governor Anusuiya Uikey and Chief Minister have extended their greetings to the people of Manipur on New Year 2024 while appealing for a collective effort to restore peace and normalcy in the state. “New Year’s Day is for making new resolutions. As we enter 2024, let us all resolve to work together for creating harmony and perfect peace in all parts of Manipur during the coming year,” the governor said in her message. She said unfortunately, Manipur has been passing through a difficult situation for the last more than seven months due to an unprecedented ethnic clash that broke out May 3 last year. Let us all try to resolve this issue collectively to bring normalcy to maintain our age-old tradition of peaceful co-existence, the governor wished. The Chief Minister said that the eight-month-long ethnic violence in the state had disrupted the fabric of peaceful co-existence among different communities while development works and economic activities slowed down and it was not a good sign for the state. The Chief Minister, in his New Year’s message, said that for nearly eight months now, Manipur has been going through one of the worst phases in its history, with the loss of many precious lives and many others uprooted from their homes. “The unprecedented ethnic conflict has, directly or indirectly, affected everyone residing in the state. It is high time that we rise together to overcome the barriers and stumbling blocks in our journey towards a better Manipur, where all its people live together peacefully, and harmoniously and get access to the facilities of a developed state,” Singh said.

175618123,Arrests in Germany over 'Cologne cathedral attack plot',"German police arrested three people on Sunday over an alleged attack plot targeting the cathedral in Cologne on New Year's Eve. The ""alleged means of attack"" is a car, said police in the western city, adding that security measures have been stepped up around the site. The three suspects are believed to be linked to a Tajik who was arrested on Christmas Eve, said Cologne police chief Johannes Hermann. The Tajik was detained by German police on the same day as Austria announced the arrests of another three suspects in Vienna. Bild daily had reported then that the four are all Tajiks who allegedly wanted to carry out attacks for Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), an IS offshoot in Afghanistan. ""Islamist people and groups"" are ""more active than ever at the moment,"" warned Herbert Reul, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, where Cologne is located. Investigations following the Tajik's arrest a week back had found that there is a plot to deploy a car as a means of attack, but ""in which way is not known to us,"" said Frank Wissbaum of Cologne police. Officers had deployed sniffer dogs to search the underground parking of the cathedral for explosives but they have not yet turned up anything suspicious. Nevertheless, protective measures have been significantly stepped up, with around 1,000 police officers deployed since this afternoon to ""protect the cathedral and the population in Cologne city center"". Reul voiced confidence that New Year's festivities can go ahead. ""I think that people can celebrate calmly in Cologne today,"" he said. - Germany on high alert - Germany has been on high alert in recent weeks over possible Islamist attacks, with the country's domestic intelligence chief warning in late November that the risk of such assaults is ""real and higher than it has been for a long time"" because of the Israel-Hamas war. The deadliest attack by Islamist extremists in Germany was carried out by an IS supporter who rammed a truck into a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, killing 12 people. Germany issued a ban on Hamas activities and organisations linked to the group in the wake of the militants' attack on Israel that killed around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Hamas militants also took some 250 hostages, of whom at least 129 are believed to still be held in Gaza. In retaliation for the deadliest attack in its history, Israel announced it would destroy Hamas and began a relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip before a ground offensive there. Gaza's Hamas government says the death toll in the Palestinian territory had reached 21,822, mostly women and children.",https://www.rawstory.com/arrests-in-germany-over-cologne-cathedral-plot/,https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/german-police-have-arrested-three-people-on-over-an-alleged-attack-plot-targeting-the-cathedral-in-cologne-on-new-year-s-eve-in.png?id=50968813&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C126%2C0%2C0,2024-01-01 13:40:51,"Agence France, Agence France-Presse","['Agence France', 'Agence France-Presse']",en,us,-0.083
175575645,Deadline for PGA Tour’s crucial talks with Saudi Public Investment Fund pushed back,"Negotiations between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) have been extended beyond the original deadline of 31 December. A Framework Agreement between the organisations, which stunned the world of men’s professional golf, was announced on 6 June and was initially intended to be concluded before the end of 2023. Discussions have been complicated by the emergence of interest from private equity groups, with the PGA Tour announcing on 10 December that it was in discussions with Strategic Sports Group (SSG), an investment group headlined by Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group. In a memo to players sent on 31 December, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said “meaningful progress” had been made with SSG and “productive conversations” continued with the DP World Tour and the PIF, which bankrolls the breakaway LIV Golf circuit. “I wanted to provide an update on our negotiations with Strategic Sports Group (SSG), the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and DP World Tour,” Monahan wrote. “As you know, the [PGA Tour policy] Board unanimously directed management to pursue exclusive negotiations with SSG. “I am pleased to report that we have made meaningful progress and have provided SSG with the due diligence information they requested.” He continued: “As we move forward in our discussions, we are focused on the finalisation of terms and drafts of necessary documents. We also continue our active and productive conversations with PIF and the DP World Tour. “While we had initially set a deadline of December 31, 2023, to reach an agreement, we are working to extend our negotiations into next year based on the progress we have made to date. “Our goal for 2024 is to reach agreements with SSG, PIF and the DP World Tour, bringing them on board as minority co-investors in PGA Tour Enterprises. These partnerships will allow us to unify, innovate and invest in the game for the benefit of players, fans and sponsors.” LIV Golf secured a major coup with the signing of Masters champion Jon Rahm on a multi-million pound deal earlier this month, despite the world number three having previously insisted he was not interested in jumping ship.",https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/pga-tour-saudi-arabia-public-investment-fund-b2471769.html,https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/09/16/PGA_Tour_Monahan_Golf_10622.jpg?width=1200,2024-01-01 13:41:29,Phil Casey,['Phil Casey'],en,gb,0.17

175601455,What the Red Arrows are doing this winter - ahead of exciting summer events,"They are one of the iconic sights of summer, but what do the Red Arrows get up to during the winter months? The popular aerobatic team, based at RAF Waddington, delighted spectators at air shows and events up and down the country between June and October last year. Now, the team are preparing for the next summer season, with training already under way. Flight Lieutenant Patrick Kershaw, who goes by the call sign Red 9, told our sister site Lincolnshire Live about the hard work now going on. ""Winter training tends to start in October, but it depends what we're doing. For instance, last year we toured the Middle East and departed the last day of October and were away until early December, so winter training didn't really start until the new year,"" he said. READ MORE: Life in and around Grimsby in 1984 captured in 21 brilliant pictures The ghost railway stations of northern Lincolnshire ""This year we've got our new team leader, Jon Bond, who has come back after leaving the team a couple of years ago, and we've got three new pilots as well. They started working [in mid-October] because we're building back to a nine ship [of planes] from an eight ship, and previously we were a seven. It's a kind of building block approach to everything. ""We tend to work in two different sections – the front section, which is 'Enid' and the back section, which is 'Hanna'. Enid starts as three aircraft and, once Red 1 [the leader] is happy, he adds Red 4 and 5 and they start to do manoeuvring and learn parts of the show."" Performing such intricate displays at close quarters requires a great deal of practise as well as skill. ""You start to learn the muscle memory of getting the skills engrained into your routine, so that every time you do it you keep it exactly the same,"" said Flt Lt Kershaw. ""For the back section, we start with Red 7, who starts to learn all the synchro opposition pass manoeuvre parameters and is mentored by Red 6. ""Once they're happy they'll start to work together, and once Red 6 is happy, he'll put myself and Red 8 into that formation to start building up. We'll do that over the course of the first few months and gradually Red 1 and Red 6 will bring that all together and start making the front section bigger. ""We'll then look to fly our first 'nine ship' around the end of February or early March time. The weather can play a massive part in the training, but it's all built into the plan so we expect to lose a few days here and there."" The Red Arrows are coming into their 60th season, having flown around 5,000 displays in 57 countries since 1964. Flying distinctive Hawk jets, the team is made up of pilots, engineers and essential support staff, with frontline, operational experience. In the spring, the team will head overseas for more training before the beginning of the 2024 season. Fans in North East Lincolnshire will be keeping their fingers crossed that the team will take part in the fly-pasts for Cleethorpes Armed Forces Weekend, with organisers expected to find out if an application has been successful in February or March. Speaking about the 2024 season, Flt Lt Kershaw said: ""I'm really excited for it. We train until the end of March and then we go away to Croatia and Greece for some training before coming back at the end of May. We then start the UK display season again. ""It will be our 60th display season so it's a big anniversary for ourselves. We're also back to a nine so we're building the team back and will be there with our trademark diamond nine over the UK.""",https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/what-red-arrows-doing-winter-9006633,https://i2-prod.hulldailymail.co.uk/incoming/article9006781.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/36459256_2018-07-02_Armed-Forces-weekend-2018-in-_ma.jpg,2024-01-01 13:45:11,"Joe Griffin, Paul Johnson","['Joe Griffin', 'Paul Johnson']",en,gb,0.042
175621469,"Cancer checks, A&E waiting times, hospital Covid infections and drug deaths – Why England’s health statistics are even worse than we were told – Talking-up Scotland","Thanks again to Dottie’s Phone for alerting me to this. All sources below. Yesterday in the Guardian: NHS figures that show more people than ever are being checked for cancer have been criticised as “misleading” by experts. Official data published on Monday reported that almost 3 million people in England were tested for cancer in 2022, a 133% increase in the decade since 2013. The latest monthly figures also show that October 2023 was the highest month on record for cancer checks, with 269,492 urgent referrals. But leading cancer experts dismissed the figures as “misleading” and “smoke and mirrors”, noting that the NHS was failing to meet every cancer target by significant margins. The October data shows that the proportion of cancer patients who waited less than two months for their first treatment after an urgent referral was 58.2%, well below the target of 85%. The equivalent figure for NHS Scotland, within 62 days, was 72%, 24% better, meaning thousands more in Scotland treated on time and hundreds of thousands in England not treated on time. A&E waiting times In August 2023, NHS Scotland’s full A&E departments were 14% faster for the 4 hour target and, shockingly, 3 times as many waited more than12 hours in England. However, the gaps are almost certainly wider. On the 4 hour wait, England has the dubious practice of restarting the clock after patients are admitted whereas in Scotland counting continues from first arrival. See this: On the 12 hour wait, this figure too was based on restarting the clock after decision to admit and not, as in Scotland, on the patient’s first arrival in A&E, until the Royal College of Emergency Medicine exposed the practice in February 2023. Hospital Covid infections Throughout the pandemic, Public Health Scotland reported weekly on hospital onset Covid infections allowing BBC Scotland the opportunity to report increases but also to ignore falls. Comparisons with England were not possible as such reporting was not required there. However, some academic research studies did allow a dramatic comparison with between 18% and 23% infection levels in England’s hospitals and only around 1% in Scotland’s hospitals. Drug deaths Scotland’s media and opposition politicians just love drug deaths and are doing their best to ignore the falling trend, 21% down in the last year. However, the comparison with England has been exposed by the UK Civil Service as deeply flawed due to a massive under-reporting of the presence of substances on death certificates by a ratio of 25.1% in England & Wales to only 1.9% in Scotland. Finally: There’s a wider message here. After decades of privatisation under the Tories and of managerialism under New Labour, England’s public service leaders cannot be trusted, motivated as they are by the need to present only positive results to those who agree their salaries and bonuses.

175579015,Nepalese man drowns while swimming off one of Hong Kong’s outlying islands,"A 46-year old man is believed to have drowned on Monday off a Hong Kong outlying island where he went for a drug treatment programme, the Post has learned The Nepalese man, a Hong Kong resident, had gone swimming with other people from Shek Kwu Chau Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre around 12.30pm on Monday, according to a source familiar with the situation. The swim had been arranged and supervised by staff at the drug rehabilitation centre, where the victim went for voluntary treatment, the source added. About 10 minutes into the swim, another man who joined the activity found the victim, surnamed Gurung, floating on the water and unresponsive, the source said. The other swimmer alerted nearby staff, who immediately called police. Hong Kong sport fisherman arrested over death of fellow angler Marine police and a Government Flying Service helicopter were dispatched to the scene. The man was airlifted by helicopter to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Chai Wan, where he was pronounced dead at around 2pm. Police said he was believed to have drowned. Officers said they were still determining whether the death was “suspicious” and warranted further investigation, the source said, adding that CCTV cameras had captured the incident. Shek Kwu Chau is a small outlying island west of Cheung Chau. The island is a restricted area that can be visited only by those with a special permit. The treatment centre provides rehabilitation services for drug abusers on a voluntary basis, and is run by the Society for the Aid and Rehabilitation of Drug Abusers. Teenager drowns at natural Hong Kong pool while exploring country park The Post has reached out to the organisation for comment. The Government Flying Service responded to about 37 drowning incidents throughout 2023, according to latest statistics available on its website. According to a 2019 report by the Department of Health, around 40 people drown each year in Hong Kong. Nearly 74 per cent of victims were male and the average age was 57. Last August, a 19-year-old drowned after he went for a swim at a popular natural pool in Sai Kung East Country Park, after splitting off from his three friends. Earlier in June, two men drowned in separate incidents on the same day while engaging in water sports in the same area.",https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3246911/nepalese-man-drowns-while-swimming-one-hong-kongs-outlying-islands,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/01/feab0363-23c3-473a-8acf-4765b94668ef_a997b585.jpg,2024-01-01 13:51:13,Connor Mycroft,['Connor Mycroft'],en,cn,-0.015

175576385,Gangster Goldy Brar declared designated terrrorist under UAPA: What this means,"Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, was declared a designated terrorist by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) on Monday (January 1). Amendments introduced in 2019 brought in provisions by which the Centre can declare individuals — not only organisations — as designated terrorists. Here is how this works. Who is a “terrorist”? The words “terror” or “terrorist” are not defined, but the UAPA defines a “terrorist act” as any act committed with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security, economic security, or sovereignty of India or with intent to strike terror or likely to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country. While the original Act dealt with “unlawful” acts related to secession; anti-terror provisions were introduced in 2004. The 2019 Bill sought to empower the central government to designate an individual a “terrorist” if they are found committing, preparing for, promoting, or involved in an act of terror. A similar provision already existed in Part 4 and 6 of the legislation for organisations that can be designated as a “terrorist organisation”. Home Minister Amit Shah, during a debate on the Bill in Lok Sabha, stressed on the need to designate individuals as terrorists to root out terrorism. How are individuals declared terrorists? The central government may designate an individual as a terrorist through a notification in the official gazette, and add his name to the Fourth Schedule to the UAPA. The government is not required to give an individual an opportunity to be heard before such a designation. At present, in line with the legal presumption of an individual being innocent until proven guilty, an individual who is convicted in a terror case is legally referred to as a terrorist, while those suspected of being involved in terrorist activities are referred to as terror accused. The 2019 amendment did not clarify the standard of proof required to establish that an individual is involved, or is likely to be involved, in terrorist activities. What happens when an individual is declared a terrorist? The designation of an individual as a global terrorist by the United Nations is associated with sanctions including travel bans, freezing of assets and an embargo against procuring arms. The 2019 amendment, however, did not provide any such detail. The amendment also gave the Centre the power to remove a name from the schedule when an individual makes an application. If an application filed by an individual declared a terrorist is rejected by the government, they have the right to seek a review within one month after the application is rejected. Under the amendment, the central government set up a review committee comprising a chairperson (a retired or sitting judge of a High Court) and three other members. The review committee will be empowered to order the government to delete the name of the individual from the schedule that lists “terrorists”, if it considers the order to be flawed. Apart from these two avenues, the individual can also move the courts challenging the government’s order.

175578907,AHI Internship Program Concludes Its 2023 Fall Session,"WASHINGTON, DC – The 2023 fall session of the American Hellenic Institute (AHI) Internship Program has officially concluded. For four decades, over 200 students and recent graduates have completed the program at AHI’s Hellenic House building, located just five blocks from the White House in Washington DC. The internship program enriches policy knowledge, supports career aspirations, and helps create strong relationships with professionals and academics, allowing for a first-hand experience of how foreign policy is created and executed in our nation’s capital. Interns work directly with staff members on various activities, including performing research and analysis, drafting letters, facilitating events, and assisting with other project-oriented tasks. They also attend lectures held at think tanks, monitor legislation and congressional hearings on Capitol Hill, draft press releases, and perform administrative duties. Anna Maria Papadopoulos and Clara Flanders took full advantage of their time as AHI interns. Previously, Anna Maria participated in the 15th annual AHIF Foreign Policy Trip to Greece and Cyprus. “I would like to thank Anna Maria and Clara for their invaluable work and contributions to AHI on multiple fronts,” AHI President Nick Larigakis said. “Educating students in the field of public policy and government is vital. They have a bright future, and we look forward to seeing their many accomplishments.” Anna Maria Papadopoulos is a senior and a Dean’s List recipient at American University, where she is majoring in Legal Studies as part of a rigorous Politics, Policy, and Law Program and the Leadership Program within the School of Public Affairs. Papadopoulos moved from Thessaloniki, Greece, two years ago with one goal; to become an advocate for her Greek-American community by achieving a well-rounded academic background and gaining experience in the political arena. Her dedication to foreign affairs advanced through her internship on Capitol Hill. While interning on the Hill, she became familiar with foreign affairs policy by attending hearings, drafting memos, and assisting with legislative research on matters of diplomacy and national defense. On campus, Papadopoulos is president of the American University Hellenic Student Association and a proud member of the AU Diplomats club, where she mentors newly admitted Greek and Cypriot students and provides a resource to facilitate their transition in the community. Moreover, this summer Papadopoulos participated in the 15th annual American Hellenic Institute Foundation Foreign Policy College Student Trip to Greece and Cyprus. Clara Flanders is a Senior and Dean’s List student at American University where she is majoring in an Interdisciplinary Studies degree of Communications, Legal Institutions, Economics, and Government. She is the recipient of the highly selective Presidential Scholarship and part of the rigorous three year Politics, Policy and Law Scholars Program at American University’s School of Public Affairs. Flanders’ interest in foreign affairs was bolstered by her study abroad experience in Brussels, Belgium, where she learned about the responsibilities of the EU and talked directly with representatives from Greece and Cyprus like European Parliament elected Member Anna-Michelle Asimakopoulou, concerning pressing geopolitical affairs. Clara also visited Greece and there was able to gain a deeper appreciation for the country and its culture and attain a more complex understanding of and interest in Greek foreign relations, specifically its diplomatic connections with the U.S. AHI offers internship positions throughout the year. The internship is an excellent opportunity for those interested in gaining experience in government affairs and foreign policy issues, specifically U.S. relations with Greece and Cyprus. It is designed for undergraduate students, graduate students, and recent graduates, and helps them explore new career avenues and jump-start professions in government, journalism, lobbying, or the nonprofit sector.

175581003,How anaerobic digestion can benefit and challenge Irish farmers,"As we await publication of the government’s National Biomethane Strategy, Ireland is playing catch-up with other countries when it comes to the large scale rollout of anaerobic digestion (AD) technology. Under the Climate Action Plan, there is a target to expand the production of agri-centric biomethane to 5.7TWh/annum by 2030, which is around 10% of Ireland’s total natural gas demand. This will require the construction of an estimated 150 to 200 AD plants around the country, a significant increase on the 15 facilities currently in operation. If the target is achieved, the emission savings would amount to almost two million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent annually. The production of indigenous biomethane is seen as playing a key role in reducing emissions from the agriculture sector. Anaerobic digestion Anaerobic digestion (AD) takes place when organic material decays or is broken down by bacteria and enzymes in the absence of oxygen. When this is carried out in a controlled environment of airtight tanks, covered lagoons or covered ponds, this is known as a biogas plant or AD plant. The organic matter is released as biogas; this is a mixture of the combustible gas methane (50-75%), carbon dioxide (25-45%), small amounts of water (2-7%) and trace gases. The type of feedstock used by anaerobic digesters can include pig or cattle slurry; food waste; energy crops (grass silage, maize-silage, grain); municipal solid waste from households and organic solid waste from industry. The biogas produced can be “upgraded” to biomethane and injected into the gas network or used as a vehicle fuel. Across Europe, where AD technology has been used since the 1970s, the gas is normally used on site to generate heat and electricity in a combined heat and power–unit (CHP). Renewable technology Although Ireland has developed other renewable technologies such as wind, solar and ordinary biomass, there has been no support mechanism introduced yet to make anaerobic digestion a reality in this country. “For any renewable technology to evolve or to emerge, it needs some level of support to get it off the ground and this would be evident right across Europe,” Barry Caslin, energy and rural development specialist with Teagasc, told Agriland. “It’s not for the faint hearted to be getting involved in the AD process, it can be quite expensive going down the whole planning route, there’s different interpretations in different local authorities. “There can be a lot of local opposition that you may have to deal with in some areas as well. So getting a project off the ground, there’s a long lead-in process,” he added. There can also be very high costs associated with connecting an AD plant to the grid. Caslin has a level of trepidation when it comes to Ireland meeting its biomethane targets as “there is a consideration amount of ground to cover” between now and the end of the decade. “When I think about all of these projects that are in incubation at the moment and realising all the challenges that these people have in getting the projects off the ground, it does seem a bit unrealistic achieving the 5.7TWh/annum target by 2030,” he said. One of the major hurdles in developing an AD plant will be financing, Caslin estimated that the 200 AD plants could cost in the region of €10 billion. “In order for people to invest in AD as a technology, they need to see that there’s policy around this whole area, and they need to see that there’s government commitment in this area,” he said. Caslin said that many investors are awaiting the details of the National Biomethane Strategy which is due to be published “fairly soon” after being worked on over the past number of years. He stressed that the document is a strategy and not a support scheme for the AD sector. Opportunities and challenges Along with helping in the transition away from fossil fuels and promoting a circular economy, AD technology offers opportunities for Irish farmers. The income generated from selling biomass, mainly grass silage, to an AD biogas plant will provide additional income streams for farm families in rural Ireland and provide a land use alternative. “We’ve got over 80,000 beef and sheep farmers in this country who make a very low gross margin per hectare who would look at this area as a potential area to give them a diversification opportunity,” Caslin said. The residue or digestate of the AD process can be separated into a liquid and fibrous fraction. The liquid can be returned to the land as a high-value fertiliser and the solid fibre used as a soil conditioner. The fermentation improves the quality of manure as nutrients are more available for plants and pathogens and weed seeds are killed through the AD process. Teagasc estimates that a total land area of 120,000ha, which is less than 3% of available land, will be needed to produce the silage to feed the AD biomethane plants. In addition, winter slurry from 1.3 million cattle will be required which represents approximately one fifth of all winter cattle slurry produced in Ireland. The land requirements could result in displacement of livestock or existing tillage production. Caslin said that livestock displacement could be mitigated against by improving grass management and utilisation on farms. “There will be challenges in mobilising the slurry together with possible resentment towards the technology in areas where grass availability for lease or conacre is in limited supply,” he said. Ireland currently imports over 70% of our energy requirements, which can be impacted by geopolitical events, as has been particularly evident in recent times. “As a nation we need to look at what is the best use of our land. Should we be using it all for food production or should we be also insulating ourselves on the side of our energy requirements going forward, which makes us more attractive in terms of foreign direct investment as well,” Caslin said.",https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/how-anaerobic-digestion-can-benefit-and-challenge-irish-farmers/,https://cdn.agriland.ie/uploads/2022/05/biogas-gf9739c160_1920.jpg,2024-01-01 14:00:00,Aisling O'Brien,"[""Aisling O'Brien""]",en,ie,0.008
175586439,Sun-Times reporter steps back while still rooting for those who carry on,"Just as with other life lessons, it took me too long to grasp this one: I’m one lucky guy. But it’s undeniable. The seeming serendipity of birth dropped me into a free land that can be great enough to rectify its problems. I had two loving, supportive parents who never went to college but encouraged an education. Let’s face it, being a white male helped, too. The journalism bug bit me when I was young and never let go. Out of it grew interest in politics and civic affairs. I covered Chicago’s City Hall for the Southtown Economist, later called the Daily Southtown, during the raucous Council Wars. And I revered the Sun-Times, with its brilliant columnists and bold investigations. It was where I wanted to be. The City Hall work drew me to business issues, first by absorbing the immense power government has through zoning and other regulations to make or break fortunes. It’s no wonder so many alderpersons have gone to the clink for trying to get a cut. It’s hard to believe now, but in the 1980s and ‘90s, journalism was financially healthy and the job market was intensely competitive. I had a couple of stopovers after the Southtown — very important as it turned out — and landed at the Sun-Times in 1996. The editors gave me wide leeway from the start and a column after a couple years. I was that rare person doing exactly what he wanted where he wanted it. I’ve called it luck, but that doesn’t do it justice. My blessings include a dear and wise wife and two children who have grown into hard-working, caring adults. With this new year, I’m ending my full-time schedule at the Sun-Times and this weekly Chicago Enterprise column, which I’ve tried to craft as a diary of the city’s changing economy. I’ll be retiring but offering occasional pieces as a “contributor at large,” which suggests I’m either an escapee or larger in the waistline because working from home means easy access to the kitchen. It’ll be the second time I’ve left my dream job. The first was in 2013. The Sun-Times now has positive, stable ownership as a nonprofit. But 10 years ago, the Sun-Times owner was destructive. He would later sell his newspaper holdings and lower his public profile following “me too” allegations. I left the paper to work for then-Gov. Pat Quinn for a couple years promoting job growth. That ended with a change in administrations. The Chicago News Guild, the union for editorial workers at the Sun-Times, asked me to help. Job No. 1 was to hunt for better owners for the Sun-Times itself. The paper was destined to be merged into the Chicago Tribune, which Craig Rosenbaum, the News Guild’s executive director, and I knew would mean the end. With his legal chops, Rosenbaum worked the antitrust angle, and I worked business and civic contacts. We later talked about how it seemed we both were supposed to be there at that given time. It was like being a matchmaker, putting people together in a room to see if they would click. We got it done, but all credit goes to those who put up the money: unions and the Chicago Federation of Labor, former Ald. Edwin Eisendrath and others at first, followed by private equity executive Michael Sacks and the late Rocky Wirtz. It led to today’s affiliation with Chicago Public Media and WBEZ, with revenue from foundations and readers. The episode proved how organized labor can do more to protect jobs than just strike or enforce contracts. And it struck a blow for competitive news in town. Many Chicagoans don’t realize it because they can access several sources of print or digital news, but journalism as done by humans and not AI is still in a free fall. Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism found that more than half of U.S. counties barely have access to local news, and the nationwide employment of newspaper journalists has fallen by two-thirds, or 43,000 jobs, since 2005. There is no intent here to hold that journalism is more important than any other job. Goodness knows, that’s annoying. We can be myopic and arrogant, even amid our reduced circumstances. But I also know most are intently serious about what they do and examine themselves to a fault. The 3 a.m. panics are common in this work — the ones where you bolt awake to say, “Did I double-check that fact?” or “I forgot to mention that other thing.” It happens a lot. Yet, here I am on my own terms able to anticipate more leisure and less hunching over a laptop. Those so inclined can look up prayers for journalists. The prayers ask for God’s grace that we write with compassion and with courage to confront injustice. I would ask also that those who do this good and sometimes dangerous work be fulfilled and have the comfort of family, friends and a decent standard of living. It’s a lot to ask, but divine help and a fighting spirit moves mountains.",https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/1/24018805/roeder-business-reporter-steps-back-rooting-chicago-suntimes-staff,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eeadbb7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1142+0+134/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FEu_IfVPxiGUKGe2bfywVh9S68ts%3D%2F0x0%3A2000x1276%2F2000x1276%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281003,2024-01-01 14:00:00,David Roeder,['David Roeder'],en,us,0.094
175582467,Arrests In Germany Over &#8216;Cologne Cathedral Attack Plot&#8217;,"German police arrested three people on Sunday over an alleged attack plot targeting the cathedral in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. The “alleged means of attack” is a car, said police in the western city, adding that security measures have been stepped up around the site. The three suspects are believed to be linked to a Tajik who was arrested on Christmas Eve, said Cologne police chief Johannes Hermann. The Tajik was detained by German police on the same day as Austria announced the arrests of another three suspects in Vienna. Bild daily had reported then that the four are all Tajiks who allegedly wanted to carry out attacks for Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), an IS offshoot in Afghanistan. “Islamist people and groups” are “more active than ever at the moment,” warned Herbert Reul, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, where Cologne is located. Investigations following the Tajik’s arrest a week back had found that there is a plot to deploy a car as a means of attack, but “in which way is not known to us,” said Frank Wissbaum of Cologne police. Officers had deployed sniffer dogs to search the underground parking of the cathedral for explosives but they have not yet turned up anything suspicious. Nevertheless, protective measures have been significantly stepped up, with around 1,000 police officers deployed since this afternoon to “protect the cathedral and the population in Cologne city center”. Reul voiced confidence that New Year’s festivities can go ahead. “I think that people can celebrate calmly in Cologne today,” he said. Germany on high alert – Germany has been on high alert in recent weeks over possible Islamist attacks, with the country’s domestic intelligence chief warning in late November that the risk of such assaults is “real and higher than it has been for a long time” because of the Israel-Hamas war. The deadliest attack by Islamist extremists in Germany was carried out by an IS supporter who rammed a truck into a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, killing 12 people. Germany issued a ban on Hamas activities and organisations linked to the group in the wake of the militants’ attack on Israel that killed around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Hamas militants also took some 250 hostages, of whom at least 129 are believed to still be held in Gaza. In retaliation for the deadliest attack in its history, Israel announced it would destroy Hamas and began a relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip before a ground offensive there. Gaza’s Hamas government says the death toll in the Palestinian territory had reached 21,822, mostly women and children.",https://independent.ng/arrests-in-germany-over-cologne-cathedral-attack-plot/,https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Daily-Independent-3.jpg,2024-01-01 14:00:02,Akin Yusuf,['Akin Yusuf'],en,ng,-0.083
175577659,"In the Peruvian Andes, the new year is welcomed with a punch-up, then a hug","The fighting begins and ends with a hug, part of a singular ritual that has residents of the Peruvian Andes punching and kicking in a year-end fight competition known as Takanakuy. Before the duelling starts in an open-air arena, male fighters remove their elaborate headgear – stuffed birds, foxes or even goat heads worn as symbols of strength or to bring good luck. Many participants in the holiday tradition come from the town of San Juan de Lurigancho in Chumbivilcas province, part of the Cusco department southeast of Peruvian capital Lima. The atmosphere is more celebratory than grim. Wearing traditional costumes or leather jackets and boots, men and women join to do the Huaylia, a traditional Andean dance. The party, however, will end in a fight. It’s all part of the Takanakuy, a Quechua-language word that means “to hit each other”. The tradition, which dates to Spanish colonial times, evolved over the centuries to become a means of settling accounts between neighbours in areas where there was no authority. Before, the fights were “about land disputes, and this was the way to resolve problems between families, between neighbours”, said 33-year-old hairdresser and fighter Froilan Rosas. Some people fight to defend personal or family honour. Takanakuy takes place every December 25 in the Peruvian regions of Cusco, Apurimac, Huancavelica and Arequipa, as well as in the Bolivian Andes. Some regions stage a variation: the women-only Warmi Takanakuy. The goal is to end the year in peace, residents say. The party pauses, and the fighting begins. A fighter challenges another by calling out his or her first and last name. The person challenged is free to refuse, and may offer a substitute. Before stepping into the ring, male fighters – some shirtless – bind their hands with cloth and swap their shoes for boots. In this club, duels are brief, lasting no more than a minute, with only punching and kicking allowed. A referee presides over the fight, and four judges decide the winner. “This is a ritual,” said Julio Boza, a burly 72-year-old and one of the organisers. “It starts with a fight and, after fighting, ends with a hug.” Above all, Boza added, “It is a way to resolve everything that we have had in the year. This is the time to resolve it.” On this day there were 10 fights before dozens of fans. Anyone, even foreigners, can join in. One enthusiastic Romanian challenged a local resident. Wearing a Peruvian football T-shirt bearing the name of his idol Paolo Guerrero, he won his bout. Although Takanakuy once was based largely on existing rivalries, today it is more a sport for the young. “We’re boys, so we want to measure our strength, to know how we’re doing,” said Omar Huachaca, 30, a merchant from Cusco. “More than anything, the blood in our veins brings us to the party.”",https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/3246907/peruvian-andes-new-year-welcomed-punch-then-hug,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/01/d196c936-b3f4-4cec-b230-2b6075ec583d_7bae406a.jpg,2024-01-01 14:00:12,Agence France-Presse,['Agence France-Presse'],en,cn,0.554

175577733,Jurgen Klopp doubles down on Anfield atmosphere view in new message to Liverpool fans,"Jurgen Klopp has called for even more from Liverpool's supporters as the Reds kick off the New Year on top of the Premier League table. The Liverpool boss hit the headlines when he criticised a small number of fans sitting behind him during the Carabao Cup quarter-final win over West Ham last month, and followed that up by calling for Anfield to be at its loudest for the visit of Arsenal just before Christmas. Writing in his programme notes ahead of the New Year's Day visit of Newcastle, Klopp says he was happy with the response shown by the fans to his call for more noise, but says he'd like things to get even louder in 2024. Klopp wrote: ""I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, the supporters, for the backing you gave us in our most recent home game against Arsenal. It was truly exceptional and I absolutely loved it. When the atmosphere is like this it is hard to imagine that there could be a better place to play or watch football. Anfield at its very best really is a sensational place. ""But – and being a manager of this club there always has to be a 'but' because the responsibility has to be to drive the highest standards – it left me wanting more. I know this is a big ask but then I also know that the conditions will be in place for a repeat. We will have, if not the very same people in every case, then definitely the same type of people, the same stadium, the same opportunity to create something special. ""January is a bit different to the other months because after playing a home league game on the first day, we will not play another until the final day, so it makes sense that we do everything we possibly can on and off the pitch to make the most of this one. Hopefully between us we can start the year in a good way."" Liverpool go into the game against Newcastle at the top of the Premier League, ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference and two points ahead of both Manchester City and Arsenal, with the latter losing 2-1 at Fulham on New Year's Eve.

175557073,Farmers caught in the growing competition for carbon,"Throughout last year (2023), the climate change chorus grew louder and shriller, calling for ever more drastic measures to curb the emissions of what are termed greenhouse gasses (GHG), which, in the main, is carbon dioxide, with methane now being roped in as a supporting villain. As of today (January 1), the world’s population stands at around 8.1 billion – a population that is based on carbon chemistry, as is all known life, and requires nutrition in the form of carbon based food. Few people are advocates of an endless population explosion, although Elon Musk has recently repeated his claim that there are still not enough people in the world – this time supported by Jeff Bezos; both are unelected billionaires who would benefit from an expanding customer base. This growth in the number of mouths to feed will require a good deal more food to be produced and, ultimately, that food will require the process of photosynthesis, natures method of fixing the sun’s energy into the solid form we call carbohydrates. Energy rich bonding The basic key of natures energy management strategy is the energy rich bond between carbon and hydrogen. Plants use solar energy to create that bond and then respiration, mostly by animals, breaks it down, releasing the energy once again to fuel the cells of our bodies. In essence, the sun provides the energy to split water to release hydrogen, which is then compounded with carbon to produce food. Oxygen just happens to be a by product of this reaction. Animals take this food and reverse the reaction in a process known as respiration, releasing carbon dioxide and water as they do so, completing several loops, one of which is the carbon cycle. A major factor limiting photosynthesis, is the availability of carbon in the form of CO2, which is why greenhouse growers add it to the air. The same applies to the atmosphere as a whole, the more CO2, the quicker crops will grow, and the more they will yield. What’s more, plants gain greater drought resistance with higher CO2 levels, and NASA satellites have recorded a significant increase in the greening of the planet since they started taking photos in the mid-80s. The bright side of Carbon Yet this positive side to CO2 levels is rarely aired, it is submerged by the doom and gloom of climate change lobbyists, and activists who are part of a multi-trillion dollar industry professing to mitigate global warming. We are therefore left with a growing conflict between the need to feed the world, and the claims of a huge climate change lobby determined to reduce the amount of carbon available to grow the required food. Nowadays, climate activists are fond to pointing to the increase in CO2 levels over the last century or so, jabbing at graphs of the preceding millennia which show CO2 levels dropping to less than 200ppm at times, a threshold below which plant life struggles to survive. Plants need for CO2 is amplified in an international study from 2018 where it was found that levels in excess of 1,100ppm were optimal for the growth of three different grass species, including ryegrass. Farmers dilemma Agriculture is caught right in the middle of this, on the one hand it is being to told to bury more carbon in the ground, while on the other, it faces the demand to feed a growing population. Adding to the organic matter content of soils is always a good idea and is an essential part of increasing and maintaining yields with less inputs, so the sequestration of carbon is only to be encouraged, although it is being found that soils differ in how much carbon they can absorb. Yet, if it is possible to reduce CO2 concentrations by significantly increasing soil organic matter levels, then how much will be left to grow the crops upon? Over the past year, this question has been asked of several machinery companies who are at the sharp end of designing implements to preserve and increase soil carbon levels, while still preparing the ground for crops. There is never a direct answer, nor is there from tractor manufacturers, which happily boast of their green credentials while continuing to supply Tier III engines to markets which don’t insist on expensive exhaust treatments. Carbon as a resource At some point, this competition for carbon will have to be acknowledged by the zealots who are insisting that economies be turned upside down in pursuit of an unrealisable ideal, and that is to halt climate change. There are two other inconvenient truths that will also need to be recognised and discussed more openly, the first being that the climate is always changing, and has been ever since photosynthesis evolved 3.5bn years ago. There are many reasons for this continual development, variation in sun radiation levels and planetary orbits and alignment being the major contenders, yet these are never mentioned in the mad dash to banish oil. There is also the strong suggestion that we are due the next ice, are we really capable of warding it off through what amounts to a miniscule change in the composition of the earths atmosphere? This is due, in the main, to a 70% increase in the demand for energy over the same period, it is now up to 178.9 TWh (Terra Watt hours) which, despite all the talk of peak oil, has been met by the increased use of fossil fuels. A handful of battery powered yard tractors is not going to make the slightest difference to the scale these figures. Farming, and society in general, has been bamboozled into thinking that carbon is bad stuff when in fact quite the opposite is true. We need it to grow our food and the more the merrier. As for it warming the planet, then there are plenty of well-respected scientists who take a far less alarmist view but, when faced with a multi-trillion dollar climate mitigation industry, their voices find it difficult to rise above the clamour.",https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/farmers-caught-in-the-growing-competition-for-carbon/,https://cdn.agriland.ie/uploads/2023/12/DSC_2420-scaled.jpg,2024-01-01 12:00:00,"Jeff Bezos, Justin Roberts","['Jeff Bezos', 'Justin Roberts']",en,ie,0.149
175592149,"Leadership turnover, officer deaths, robbery spike challenged CPD in 2023","For Mayor Brandon Johnson and new leaders of the Chicago Police Department, the dust has started to settle. After a year of sweeping changes and more controversy, the department enters 2024 with a new permanent boss facing a long to-do list: Foster stronger community relationships. Reduce violent crime and shootings. Raise the homicide clearance rate. Maintain officer wellness and morale. And prepare for August, when the city will have an international spotlight as it hosts the 2024 Democratic National Convention. That work will come after a year that saw a mix of highs and lows for the Police Department. Homicide and nonfatal shooting totals fell again, but the city was roiled by robbery and carjacking crews responsible for an overall uptick in violence. Other high-profile crimes gripped the city’s attention at various points during the year, too, like a bizarre August shooting inside Guaranteed Rate Field during a White Sox home game that left two women injured. “Teen takeovers,” the large, unorganized youth gatherings in the downtown area, again left city leaders scratching their heads. Meanwhile, thousands of migrants, mostly from Venezuela, spent months living in and around CPD stations across the city. At the same time, the first class of CPD district councilors — community relations liaisons between police officers and district residents — was sworn in. Larry Snelling meets with the public Sept. 7, 2023, after answering questions at the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood. Snelling, who was the Chicago Police Department's chief of counterterrorism at the time, is now the police superintendent. Johnson’s selection of Larry Snelling to lead CPD came after weeks of public meetings organized by the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability, the new body tasked with submitting CPD superintendent finalists and police board nominees to the mayor. Since he was unanimously approved by the City Council in September, Snelling has repeatedly called for a collaborative and nuanced effort in the city’s crime reduction efforts. In an interview with the Tribune, Snelling said identifying specific problems in each of the CPD’s 22 patrol districts is paramount. “That’s how we get to the bottom of it. We can’t get to the bottom of it with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ strategy, because that strategy is not going to fit within every district,” Snelling said. “So the key is to have a focus on the specific crime that is ailing each particular district or each area. A Far North Side district is not going to have the exact same problems that a Far South Side district. They’ll have some of those problems, but not the clusters, not the amount, not the percentages, so we have to focus on those things as such.” What’s more, the new superintendent has used many of his public appearances to recast attention not on the perpetrators, but the victims of violent crime. Snelling, who grew up in Englewood and first joined the CPD in 1992, also pledged to balance aggressive policing strategies with transparency, even as progress remains slow in the department’s adherence to the federal consent decree that was born out of the 2014 murder of Laquan McDonald. A Tribune analysis of CPD records found that more than 11,000 internal misconduct investigations have been initiated since the consent decree was codified in early 2019. The department hired 698 new officers in 2023, a total that “basically broke even” with the number of retiring officers, Snelling told the Tribune. Though Snelling will likely be the CPD’s only leader in 2024, he was one of four men in 2023 to helm the nation’s second-largest police department. The CPD started the year under David Brown, the former chief of police in Dallas who was handpicked by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot in April 2020. New Chicago police Officer Talisa Ligon, right, hugs her sister, Shaurice Gause, after the Chicago Police Department graduation ceremony in the Aon Grand Ballroom at Navy Pier on Nov. 14, 2023. Brown’s tenure as superintendent was a rocky one, largely defined by civil unrest and looting during the COVID-19 pandemic, a spike in violent crime, and Brown’s unpopularity among rank-and-file cops. Brown announced his resignation a day after Lightfoot failed to qualify for the mayoral runoff election, taking an executive position at a Texas-based law firm. First Deputy Superintendent Eric Carter led the department until May, when Mayor Brandon Johnson selected Fred Waller, the former CPD chief of patrol who retired in August 2020, to serve as interim superintendent until a permanent leader was selected. Both Johnson and Snelling credited Waller for fostering a sense of stability within the department after Brown returned to Texas. But Waller’s time atop the department was not without controversy. In June, the CPD’s head of constitutional policing and reform, Tina Skahill, abruptly resigned from the department after lodging a claim of “retaliation.” Skahill, a veteran CPD supervisor who spent decades within the department, left her post less than a year after Brown fired her predecessor, Robert Boik. Waller, a department fixture who enjoyed great popularity among supervisors and rank and file cops, secured a salary-pension double-dip when Johnson called on him to return to the department. Shortly after he handed the reins to Snelling, Waller was again rehired as the deputy director of Snelling’s office. Snelling, though, has yet to announce any other changes to the CPD’s command staff. The selection of Snelling — who spent much of his career as an instructor in the training academy — was received positively by many within the CPD. Soon after he took over, Snelling did away with a policy that gave officers minimal notice before their regular days off were canceled. In recent weeks, the city has relocated most of the more than 2,000 migrants who spent months living in and around CPD district stations across the city. Ashley Jackson becomes emotional Sept. 23, 2023, during a wake at the New Beginnings Church for her 15-year-old son, Swaysee Rankin, who was shot and killed on Labor Day. A citywide surge in robberies and carjackings, in addition to the steady drumbeat of gun violence that ticks up each summer, left many city residents feeling on edge. According to CPD data, more than 10,800 robberies were reported across the city in 2023, a 23% increase over 2022. The department logged more than 28,000 motor vehicle thefts in 2023, a 38% jump from the year prior. “I want the next generation of shooters to not become shooters, but the generation right now is what we’re all freaked out about and why I worry about my kid riding her bike two blocks from her house,” Rod O’Connor, a resident of Humboldt Park for more than two decades, said during a community safety meeting in September. Meanwhile, the city’s annual homicide tally fell for the third year in a row. Through Dec. 28, Chicago had recorded 648 homicides, still the most of any city in America, but down from 712 homicides in 2022, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. Chicago police use a slightly lower number, eliminating killings deemed non-criminal and those on expressways within the city limits. Through Dec. 30, there were 2,877 people shot across the city in 2023, according to a CPD spokesperson — a decrease of nearly 600 shooting victims from 2022. However, a Tribune analysis in November found the city is in the midst of a sustained uptick in youth homicides. Several more mass shootings were seen, too, including one at a park cookout in Roseland over the Juneteenth holiday weekend and another at a Halloween party in North Lawndale. In late August, the department handled one of the year’s most bizarre incidents. Two women were shot as they sat in the bleachers of Guaranteed Rate Field while the White Sox played the Oakland A’s. No one has been charged in that shooting, and CPD sources have previously suggested that no one will face criminal charges. In late spring and summer, the city’s downtown area once again witnessed a spate of large-scale youth gatherings that sometimes turned violent. Sixteen people were arrested after three teens were shot during an unseasonably warm weekend in April. Another 40 people were arrested during a similar gathering in July. Then CPD Counterterrorism Chief Larry Snelling, who has since become police superintendent, comforts Carmen Cruz, who lost her son, Officer John Cruz, to suicide, during a Fraternal Order of Police ceremony on Sept. 1, 2023, to unveil a Suicide Memorial. Two Chicago police officers were killed in 2023. Andres Vasquez-Lasso was fatally shot in March as he chased an allegedly armed suspect in the Gage Park neighborhood. The suspect was also shot but survived, and his case is still pending. Two months later, Aréanah Preston was shot to death outside her home in Avalon Park shortly after she finished her shift at work. Four teens were charged in her killing. And while Vasquez-Lasso and Preston received traditionally large funeral services, replete with first responders and elected officials, the union that represents CPD officers took steps this year to recognize officers who have died by suicide. In September, the Fraternal Order of Police unveiled a memorial at the entrance of the union’s West Loop lodge to commemorate more than a dozen CPD officers who have died by suicide since 2018. “I think the thing we want most is for our loved ones to be remembered,” Margaret Dougherty, whose husband, Sgt. Edward Dougherty, died by suicide in March 2022, said at the unveiling. “Something like this, just the acknowledgment and the love that they’re showing, it just helps to keep the memory alive.” John Catanzara, president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, arrives before a meeting of the City Council Committee on Workforce Development on ratifying the new police contract on Dec. 7, 2023, at Chicago City Hall. An arbitrator’s ruling during contract negotiations between the city and its largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, produced perhaps the year’s biggest controversy involving the Police Department. In an award made public over the summer, arbitrator Edwin Benn ruled that members of the FOP, a public-sector union, are entitled to having a third party hear and decide the most serious misconduct cases. Those hearings would be off-limits to the public and press. For more than six decades, the nine-member Chicago Police Board was the arbiter in such cases — those in which the CPD superintendent has sought an officer’s firing or, at least, a yearlong suspension. The agreement between the city and union also provided for a nearly 20% raise for officers over four years, on top of a one-time $2,500 bonus. Beyond that, the deal creates a new “Peoples’ Court” where more minor police discipline cases can be decided by an arbitrator in a single day. The deal also paved the way for a new rotation of homicide detectives aimed at improving the department’s homicide clearance rate, which hovered near 50% throughout 2023. The FOP, citing Benn’s award, tried in August to remove 22 pending disciplinary cases from the Police Board’s docket and have them decided instead by a third party. The board shot down the effort. One of those 22 officers, David Laskus, was later ordered fired over his actions during an arrest at the Brickyard Mall in 2020, though court records show Laskus has filed a lawsuit seeking to reverse that decision. The City Council held two votes on the tentative contract agreement: one for the economic package, the lion’s share of the deal, and another to address Benn’s arbitration award. The economic package was approved, but the council voted against the disciplinary provision. John Catanzara, the FOP president, predicted a costly legal fight for the city. “They want war; we’ll give you war,” Catanzara said in an interview with the Tribune following the vote. With its future up in the air, the Police Board saw much turnover in 2023, too. Ghian Foreman’s final term as board president ended, though he’s agreed to continue serving so that the board can reach a voting quorum. The terms of two other board members, the Rev. Michael Eaddy and Mareilé Cusack, also expired, though their replacements have not yet been named. Kyle Cooper, the board’s new president, presided over his first meeting in December. It was then that the board’s vice president, Paula Wolff, announced that four officers would face an evidentiary hearing for misconduct allegations lodged against them in the nearly 20-year-old case of disgraced former CPD Sgt. Ronald Watts, perhaps providing an early test for the reconstituted panel.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-cpd-year-end-20240101-czl3beotkjbtrc42y3y5z2gzgq-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/XnY9x7CsgAH-DjahpjbhpOTivps=/4228x2819/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/NDE666UZRBA3TPWTDHHV7FNCXY.JPG,2024-01-01 12:00:00,Sam Charles,['Sam Charles'],en,us,-0.138
175725585,Big workplace changes are coming in 2024. Are you ready?,"If you thought the pandemic and AI revolution changed work in the past four years, get ready for epic changes coming in 2024. During the past three years, the world of work was turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology saved the economy by enabling millions to work from home using video calls, cloud services, and collaboration software. Then last year, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) changed everything; 2023 was its “breakout year,” according to a survey-based report by McKinsey. The 2023 surge in awareness about large language model (LLM)-based genAI technology resulted from OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and DALL-E tools in 2022. This category of AI has been in development for decades in hundreds of university and corporate labs. But OpenAI was the first to offer the tools to the public (and to developers through application programming interfaces (APIs) as well as to users of Microsoft’s Bing search engine). Easy availability triggered a surge in usage. “ChatGPT” became a mainstream brand. Other organizations scrambled to make their own research publicly usable. Now, in the world of business technology, genAI is everything. It started last spring. By April, a quarter of C-suite executives were using genAI for work and a quarter of boards of directors were talking about using it in the workplace, according to McKinsey, even as both executives and board members remained concerned about the accuracy of AI output. That concern reveals that some view genAI tools as a kind of search engine, confusing the ability of the technology with the quality of the datasets available tools are trained on. In 2024, that confusion will be clarified for many because companies will take a hybrid approach to implementing the fast-evolving technology at work. The big move away from canned data began in November, when OpenAI’s Sam Altman announced GPTs that enable users to create custom versions of ChatGPT for specific purposes. GPTs enable the user’s own data to augment ChatGPT’s training dataset. Over time, tools that enable organizations’ (or industry’s) own data will demonstrate that AI chatbot “hallucinations,” as well as other transgressions, arise because of the data, not the AI technology. Using custom data sets will prove vastly more powerful for true insight and actionable results than generic ones. In any event, the OpenAI chatbot scenario will turn out to be a relatively minor part of the genAI contribution to productivity and knowledge work. In 2024, the technology will be baked into cybersecurity, software development, productivity, customer service, human resources, fleet management and other software and cloud tools. In general, these AI features will help people cope with rising complexity in all things and give them an edge in analysis and pattern spotting. GenAI use will grow vastly more relevant with more specific data inputs and integration into focused applications. The integration of this technology into industry- and occupation-specific solutions will also be accompanied by a cultural backlash against the breathless hype of 2023. Companies that try to replace employees outright with AI will realize that humans empowered with well-designed AI tools are far more effective than AI working on its own. As with all new technologies, once the hype dies down and the tech becomes a ubiquitous banality, we’ll know it’s become truly powerful, useful ,and transformative. In general, AI will become universal and normal, even as it boosts economic output much as the PC, networking, and web revolutions did in the 1990s. Get ready for a new set of realities We’ve been talking about augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) for many years. But 2024 is the year high-resolution, high-quality AR goes mainstream (and by “mainstream,” I mean that Apple will launch its AR product, the Apple Vision Pro). No, the Vision Pro itself won’t become a mass-market product like the iPhone anytime soon, or ever. Because of the difficulty in sourcing and manufacturing, as well as the high purchase price, large size and limited battery life, unit sales will be lower than other Apple products. Estimates range from 200,000 to 500,000 units in the first year. Canalys estimates unit sales to exceed 10 million per year within four years. By comparison Apple sells well over 200 million iPhones every year. Analysts expect lower-cost Vision Pro versions, as well as smaller and lighter headsets, in the years to come to drive higher sales. (And it will affect the larger AR/VR industry.) It’s also worth noting that Vision Pro technologies will spill over into other Apple Products, dragooning the entire Apple ecosystem into its orbit. For example, MacBook Pro users will be doing FaceTime calls with Vision Pro users. The laptop users will have their faces 3D scanned, and they’ll see the 3D scanned avatar of the Vision Pro user as a participant in the meeting. Users of Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max smartphones will be able to use those devices to capture 3D “spacial” videos viewable on Vision Pro devices. These are two early ways that non-Vision Pro users can participate in Vision Pro technologies, and there will surely be others coming in the future. As with Apple’s previous entries into the music player, smartphone, tablet and smart watch markets, the Vision Pro will put buyers, competitors, and developers on notice, focusing the industry on the new category. By the end of 2024, AR will be ubiquitous and inescapable. Dozens of major companies will offer Vision Pro-like AR/VR solutions optimized for the workplace at a wide range of prices. In this case, enterprise-specific AR solutions will lead the way, with consumer devices lagging. Another category of AR will hit companies in unexpected ways; I call it non-holographic AR, and the leader in this industry will be Meta, which is already testing something it calls multimodal AI. Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which shipped Oct. 17, have a camera, which can be used for taking pictures and videos and live-streaming to Instagram or Facebook. With a software update (available first to early adopters in December), users will be able to use the camera to recognize objects and get AI-driven information and even advice (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the feature by asking what pants might go well with a shirt he was holding.) The use of internet-connected glasses with cameras (by Meta and its many coming competitors) to augment reality (with the output coming in the form of spoken words from AI rather than holographic visual objects) are going to affect business, as a growing percentage of employees in all departments will be wearing them all day, every day. The impact will be akin to the smartphone revolution, where the power of computers, apps, the internet and digital communication will be made much more accessible and quickly available through glasses than via a smartphone. The combination of Apple its mainstreaming high-resolution holographic AR and Meta mainstreaming its non-holographic AR means the workplace will be transformed by AR starting in 2024. Flex work will be the new normal The pandemic forced businesses to allow remote work at scale for the first time ever. Many employees got used to it, and now prefer working from home. But a large number of businesses continues to resist the trend, imposing back-to-office mandates. While the work-from-home (WFH) standoff has become the conventional wisdom, it’s also a misleading oversimplification. In fact, many organizations are thriving with remote and hybrid work policies. And many employees love coming to the office. A recent study by FORA found that the youngest workers, aged 18 to 24, are the most enthusiastic bracket for wanting to work in offices; this group also responds best to in-office perks like cafes, gyms, and rules allowing pets at work. Large companies that impose back-to-office mandates on employees who don’t want to commute or work in an office face pushback in the form of petitions, resignations, and difficulty in hiring. Even the most strident back-to-office companies are explicitly hiring for remote positions in job areas of highest demand, knowing that the only way to hire the best workers is to offer a WFH option. Some workplace specialists say companies are even using back-to-office mandates as a way to lay off employees without laying them off, knowing large numbers will quit in response to the mandates (or can be fired for cause if they refuse to return). Still, the reality is that for many companies, allowing remote work is essential for meeting inclusivity targets and coping with talent shortages. What’s lost on many organizations is that the “mandate” part of back-to-office mandates is the most objectionable part. Working from home enables workers to tailor their work schedule in a way that enables them to cope with the many other “mandates” in their lives. As a simple example, a family with two spouses and two children can be a scheduling nightmare. If both adults are “mandated” to be in the office until 5pm, and the school “mandates” that one of the children be picked up at 3pm, the problem is obvious. In reality, modern family life is far more complicated than that, and no workplace can schedule work time better than the employee. So, whether employees are working in the office, at home, or a mix of both, flex work will be the new normal in 2024. “Flex work” is less about where one works and more about when. Allowing employees to work when they choose — and providing the asynchronous communication tools to enable that — will be essential to hiring and retaining employees in 2024. Forcing employees to work in an office during set hours diminishes mental and physical health, wastes time, costs more, increases distraction, reduces productivity, degrades morale and damages work-life balance. Companies that fail to offer flex work and remote work will have a harder time competing in the marketplace because their workforce will tend to be understaffed, overworked and over-stressed. By contrast, companies that offer flex and remote work options will have a competitive advantage. A Darwinian process will favor those who cultivate the cultures and management styles that make flex work succeed. The dinosaurs will die out. The bottom line is that changes are surely coming to how, when, and where we work. The time to prepare for the new technology-enabled workplace — the new world of AI, AR and flex work — is now.",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3711762/big-workplace-changes-are-coming-in-2024-are-you-ready.html,https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2023/07/14/10/high_speed_train_tunnel_motion_blue_long_exposure_speed_motion_forward_progress_future_whats_next_by_mlenny_gettyimages-1195455865_2400x1600-100877732-large-100943403-large.jpg?auto=web,2024-01-01 12:00:00,,[],en,us,0.092
175559319,Animals Believed to Be Extinct Were Found All Over the World This Year,"The past year brought a glimmer of positive conservation news as several animal species thought to be extinct were rediscovered.Species have gone extinct at a much higher rate than is expected with evolution, and the blame has largely been placed on humans and their detrimental impact on certain species' environments. Experts believe that the modern extinction rate is as much as 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate, according to the World Wildlife Fund. But rediscovering a species previously thought to be extinct provides a spark of hope.The animals found across the globe included such species as reptiles, fish and mammals.In October, an extinct colony of little penguins was reestablished after 30 years when a chick hatched for the first time since 1993. A breeding pair finally returned to the Eagles Claw Nature Reserve, located in Eden, Australia. Researchers thought that predators such as foxes had hunted the species to extinction.Typically, a species is declared extinct if it hasn't been sighted for more than 50 years. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) followed the guidelines for decades, but the organization refined them in the 1990s so that a species can be listed as extinct if there is ""no reasonable doubt that the last individual member has died,"" according to Discover magazine.Newsweek reached out to the IUCN by email for comment.Another species also was found to be living in Australia this year after it was previously thought to have permanently vanished: a rare lizard called the Lyon's grassland striped skink.The skink hadn't been seen for 42 years, and researchers feared it was extinct. However, the skink reappeared in April in northeastern Queensland after researchers embarked on a mission to identify highly threatened reptiles in the area.A scent detection dog was used in South Africa to find the De Winton's golden mole, an elusive mammal that lives almost entirely underground and doesn't leave behind tunnels as other species of moles do.""Though many people doubted that De Winton's golden mole was still out there, I had good faith that the species had not yet gone extinct,"" Cobus Theron, a senior conservation manager at Endangered Wildlife Trust and a member of the search team, said in a press release. ""I was convinced it would just take the right detection method, the proper timing and a team passionate about finding it.""He continued: ""I think it's just fantastic that in 2023 we can still rediscover species. All of our stories around conservation are doom and gloom. Here we have an opportunity to say that actually there are opportunities to make change.""Most of the animals thought to be extinct were difficult to find. For example, Attenborough's long-beaked echidna—named after British naturalist, writer and historian David Attenborough—was discovered in New Guinea solely through sightings on trail cameras. Before the video sightings in November, the echidna hadn't been seen for 60 years.Once rediscovered, some animals still face the threat of endangerment, but that wasn't the case for a species of fish in the North Sea. Scientists discovered an abundance of houting, a whitefish species, thriving throughout the sea after it was officially declared extinct in 2008.The fish wasn't evasive or endangered—but its DNA was so genetically similar to the European whitefish that they were considered the same species.Despite the rediscovery news, extinction is still a massive threat to thousands of species. The IUCN lists more than 40,000 species as threatened, with more than 9,000 species considered critically endangered.",https://www.newsweek.com/animals-believed-extinct-were-found-all-over-world-this-year-1855785,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2328624/animals-thought-extinct-rediscovered-2023.png,2024-01-01 12:00:01,Anna Skinner,['Anna Skinner'],en,us,-0.088
175585505,Kilkenny photograph is overall junior winner in forest photo competition,"The overall winners of the 2023 Teagasc forest photo competition have been announced by the Minister of State for Land Use and Biodiversity, Senator Pippa Hackett. This year’s competition, “Celebrating the New Forestry Programme 2023 – 2027”, had three themes and, for the first time, both an adult and junior age category. Each theme winner was chosen by a panel of judges and the final selection of the overall winners in each age category was by popular choice. Voting was brisk all weekend and today the winners were finally clear. The overall winner in the adult category is Adrian Nolan from County Galway. Adrian’s striking photo is very well composed and reminds us that fungi play an essential role in the forest cycle, and as part of its biodiversity, and are often overlooked. In the junior category the deserving winner is Jake Byrne from Kilkenny. Jake’s image (below) was simple, yet really impactful. It captured the sense of fun that can be had from a few pieces of timber combined with a good sprinkling of imagination. Each of the winners will receive a voucher for €300 to add to their earlier voucher of the same amount bringing their total winnings to €600. Congratulating, the competition winners, Minister Hackett said: “I am delighted to announce Adrian and Jake as the overall and well-deserved winners. I would like to thank all the entrants for showcasing such wonderful examples of the many roles forests play in all our lives”. Minister Hackett continued; “I would also like to thank Teagasc for their important work in promoting and celebrating the variety of themes contained within the new Forestry Programme 2023-2027. This programme is the most ambitious to date and supports landowners to plant trees in a manner that provides lasting climate, biodiversity, wood production, employment, and wider societal benefits. Forests have an important and lasting influence across generations, and I welcome that this competition reflects this, with two new distinct age categories.” Teagasc Forestry Liaison Officer Paul Butler, who co-ordinated the initiative said: “Teagasc sincerely thanks all participants who submitted high quality photographs to our 2023 competition. It really is a pleasure see the varied ways the ecosystems, products and services of our forests are reflected in the images presented. I would also like to thank the judging panel who had such a challenging task in selecting the winners in each theme and also the Teagasc Public Relations Department for their invaluable help in promoting the competition. We look forward to organising another photo competition in 2024”. The winning photos from the Teagasc forest photo competition will shortly be available to view on the Teagasc website at www.teagasc.ie/forestphotos . This competition was coordinated by Teagasc with support from the Forestry Division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM).",https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/farming-news/1382701/kilkenny-photograph-is-overall-junior-winner-in-forest-photo-competition.html,https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/resizer/-1/-1/true/2023_12_29/Overall_winners_of_Teagasc_Forest_Photo_Competition_2023_%281%29-1703853690735.jpg--.jpg?1703853692040,2024-01-01 12:00:01,Sian Moloughney,['Sian Moloughney'],en,ie,0.771
175564529,We Absolutely Do Not Need an FDA for AI,"I don't know whether artificial intelligence (AI) will give us a 4-hour workweek, write all of our code and emails, and drive our cars—or whether it will destroy our economy and our grasp on reality, fire our nukes, and then turn us all into gray goo. Possibly all of the above. But I'm supremely confident about one thing: No one else knows either. November saw the public airing of some very dirty laundry at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence research organization that brought us ChatGPT, when the board abruptly announced the dismissal of CEO Sam Altman. What followed was a nerd game of thrones (assuming robots are nerdier than dragons, a debatable proposition) that consisted of a quick parade of three CEOs and ended with Altman back in charge. The shenanigans highlighted the many axes on which even the best-informed, most plugged-in AI experts disagree. Is AI a big deal, or the biggest deal? Do we owe it to future generations to pump the brakes or to smash the accelerator? Can the general public be trusted with this tech? And—the question that seems to have powered more of the recent upheaval than anything else—who the hell is in charge here? OpenAI had a somewhat novel corporate structure, in which a nonprofit board tasked with keeping the best interests of humanity in mind sat on top of a for-profit entity with Microsoft as a significant investor. This is what happens when effective altruism and ESG do shrooms together while rolling around in a few billion dollars. After the events of November, this particular setup doesn't seem to have been the right approach. Altman and his new board say they're working on the next iteration of governance alongside the next iteration of their AI chatbot. Meanwhile, OpenAI has numerous competitors—including Google's Bard, Meta's Llama, Anthropic's Claude, and something Elon Musk built in his basement called Grok—several of which differentiate themselves by emphasizing different combinations of safety, profitability, and speed. Labels for the factions proliferate. The e/acc crowd wants to ""build the machine god."" Techno-optimist Marc Andreessen declared in a manifesto that ""we believe intelligence is in an upward spiral—first, as more smart people around the world are recruited into the techno-capital machine; second, as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems such as companies and networks; third, as Artificial Intelligence ramps up the capabilities of our machines and ourselves."" Meanwhile Snoop Dogg is channeling AI pioneer-turned-doomer Geoffrey Hinton when he said on a recent podcast: ""Then I heard the old dude that created AI saying, 'This is not safe 'cause the AIs got their own mind and these motherfuckers gonna start doing their own shit.' And I'm like, 'Is we in a fucking movie right now or what?'"" (Hinton told Wired, ""Snoop gets it."") And the safetyists just keep shouting the word guardrails. (Emmett Shear, who was briefly tapped for the OpenAI CEO spot, helpfully tweeted this faction compass for the uninitiated.) wake up babe, AI faction compass just became more relevant pic.twitter.com/MwYOLedYxV — Emmett Shear (@eshear) November 18, 2023 If even our best and brightest technologists and theorists are struggling to see the way forward for AI, what makes anyone think that the power elite in Washington, D.C., and state capitals are going to get there first? When the release of ChatGPT 3.5 about a year ago triggered an arms race, politicians and regulators collectively swiveled their heads toward AI like a pack of prairie dogs. State legislators introduced 191 AI​-related bills this year, according to a September report from the software industry group BSA. That's a 440 percent increase from the number of AI-related bills introduced in 2022. In a May hearing of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, at which Altman testified, senators and witnesses cited the Food and Drug Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as models for a new AI agency, with Altman declaring the latter ""a great analogy"" for what is needed. Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D–Conn.) and Josh Hawley (R–Mo.) released a regulatory framework that includes a new AI regulatory agency, licensing requirements, increased liability for developers, and many more mandates. A bill from Sens. John Thune (R–S.D.) and Amy Klobuchar (D–Minn.) is softer and more bipartisan, but would still represent a huge new regulatory effort. And President Joe Biden announced a sweeping executive order on AI in October. But ""America did not have a Federal Internet Agency or National Software Bureau for the digital revolution,"" as Adam Thierer has written for the R Street Institute, ""and it does not need a Department of AI now."" Aside from the usual risk throttling of innovation, there is the concern about regulatory capture. The industry has a handful of major players with billions invested and a huge head start, who would benefit from regulations written with their input. Though he has rightly voiced worries about ""what happens to countries that try to overregulate tech,"" Altman has also called concerns about regulatory capture a ""transparently, intellectually dishonest response."" More importantly, he has said: ""No one person should be trusted here….If this really works, it's quite a powerful technology, and you should not trust one company and certainly not one person."" Nor should we trust our politicians. One silver lining: While legislators try to figure out their priorities on AI, other tech regulation has fallen by the wayside. Regulations on privacy, self-driving cars, and social media have been buried by the wave of new bills and interest in the sexy new tech menace. One thing is clear: We are not in a Jurassic Park situation. If anything, we are experiencing the opposite of Jeff Goldblum's famous line about scientists who ""were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" The most prominent people in AI seem to spend most of their time asking if they should. It's a good question. There's just no reason to think politicians or bureaucrats will do a good job answering it.",https://reason.com/2024/01/01/we-absolutely-do-not-need-an-fda-for-ai/,https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2023/12/topicsfuture.jpg,2024-01-01 12:00:16,Katherine Mangu-Ward,['Katherine Mangu-Ward'],en,us,0.035
175563363,"Rock trio HotWax: ‘After Covid, bands are like: we’ll just do what we want’","From West SussexRecommended if you like Hole, the White Stripes, the BreedersUp next Debut album and a UK tour The members of the rock trio HotWax attest that their 2023 has been “crazy”. At the start of the year, they had never even been on tour. When I speak to them, they have just returned from a month playing around the US. “It blew our minds,” enthuses the vocalist and guitarist Tallulah Sim-Savage. “Even though the drives were really long, it was like watching a 12-hour film of some interesting scenery.” They spent the summer playing festivals. They went to Italy at the behest of One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson for his Away from Home festival, played Reading and Leeds and – most surreally of all for HotWax – supported Yeah Yeah Yeahs at All Points East. “My favourite band,” nods Sim-Savage. “My dream band to support, so I was terrified, but I really just let go and enjoyed the experience.” The feeling appeared to be mutual: when Yeah Yeah Yeah played Maps, Karen O dedicated it to them. They have released two acclaimed EPs and been heralded as part of a new wave of incendiary guitar bands, including Spiritual Cramp, Lambrini Girls and Duvet. If you are looking for a vague pointer towards their raging sound, Sim-Savage has previously credited the sound of her mum playing Hole’s Live Through This as “the thing that changed everything”. Things seem to be moving very fast, but as the bassist Lola Sam points out, it has been a long time coming. She and Sim-Savage have been in bands together since they were 13; they started HotWax two years later, in 2019. They gigged around their native Hastings, performing largely improvised and instrumental sets of what Sam calls “wishy-washy psychedelia” (the kind of music, Sim-Savage suggests, that you might make if “you’re 15 and in Covid and smoking loads of weed”), before their style took a turn. “Everything is more organised now,” says Sam. “It’s more structured. It became more heavy and more poppy at the same time.” They found their drummer, Alfie Sayer, while studying at the music college Bimm in Brighton. His recruitment aside, their tenure there doesn’t sound like it was a roaring success: Sam lasted a term (“it was very much, like, jazz boys who wanted to play like that”). They dropped out, self-released singles and played “wherever would have us”, but by Sim-Savage’s reckoning they “didn’t really know what we were doing” until they met their manager, whose suggestion that they could “actually try and do this properly” so startled the band that Sim-Savage initially turned her down. “We never did this to do really well or whatever,” she frowns. “It’s just something we really, really enjoyed doing.” And yet they are clearly doing really well, offering a fierce counterargument to the long-held wisdom that noisy guitar rock has had its day. “I think it’s got something to do with Covid,” says Sam. “Bands were on the rise, then had to stop deciding to really go for it. People were stuck in for so long. Now, they’re like: no, we’ll just do what we want to do when we have the chance.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/01/rock-trio-hotwax-after-covid-bands-are-like-well-just-do-what-we-want,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a92f54f8efe91663909af59d150eb640c640ccf7/0_99_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm,2024-01-01 12:00:29,Alexis Petridis,['Alexis Petridis'],en,us,0.155
175557159,What’s next for tech in 2024?,"Have you ever wondered what the future will look like? Well, you don’t have to wait too long, because 2024 is going to be a year full of amazing innovations that will blow your mind. Here are seven emerging trends and innovations in tech that will no doubt transform our lives over the next year. CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER 1) Artificial Intelligence continues to revolutionize our lives AI is everywhere, from our daily gadgets like smartphones and smart speakers, to our smart homes that can adjust the temperature, lighting, and security according to our preferences. But AI is not just making our lives more convenient and comfortable, it’s also set to revolutionize healthcare and other industries with some groundbreaking innovations. Neuralink's revolutionary wireless device One of the most anticipated and ambitious projects in this field of AI is Neuralink, a brain-computer interface company founded by Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX. Neuralink aims to create a wireless device that can be implanted in the brain and connect it to a computer or a smartphone, allowing users to control devices, access information, and communicate with others just by thinking. Imagine controlling prosthetic limbs or enhancing cognitive abilities just by thinking. MORE: TOP 10 WEIRDEST TECH INNOVATIONS OF 2023 Keep an eye on Kernel Neuralink is not the only company working on brain-computer interfaces. Other ones to keep an eye on are Kernel, a neurotech company, which is creating a ""mind-reading"" helmet that uses sensors and lasers to gain information about the brain’s activity, blood oxygen levels, and more. By collecting detailed data on how the brain works and behaves, the hope is it could lead to new insights and breakthroughs in mental health, aging, cognition, and other aspects of brain health. THE VERY WORST AND WEAKEST PASSWORDS OF 2023 Meta bets on AI and the Metaverse Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, is leading the way with its two long-term bets on the future: AI and the metaverse. These two technologies are not only advancing rapidly, but also converging to create new possibilities for human interaction and creativity. AI is becoming more accessible and powerful than ever, thanks to Meta’s open-source models like Llama and Llama 2, which have been adopted and improved by millions of developers around the world. AI is also becoming more integrated into the products we use every day, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, where you can generate images, chat with assistants, write better, and edit photos with ease. The metaverse is also taking shape, with Meta’s Reality Labs developing new devices and platforms that enable immersive and social experiences in virtual and augmented reality. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses were the first step towards a future where AI can see the world from our perspective and help us navigate it. The Meta AI assistant is a new kind of companion that will be launched in 2024. It can understand and respond to your voice, vision, and gestures. Since Meta is trying to play catch-up with ChatGPT, it hired a couple dozen big-name celebrities to be the look and voice of Meta’s new AI voice assistant. The celebs will embody the AI and play them. 2) Augmented reality is taking us to new dimensions Augmented reality, or AR, is the technology that overlays digital information and images on the real world, creating a mixed reality experience. AR is taking us to new dimensions, as companies like Apple, Meta, Snapchat, and Niantic are creating immersive and engaging experiences that enhance our perception and interaction with the world. But don't think AR is just for gaming and entertainment, it’s also for education and learning. AR can make learning more fun and interactive, as it can bring subjects and concepts to life. Augmented reality is bringing shopping to you Another domain where AR is making a big impact is shopping. AR can help you make better and more informed decisions, as it can let you try on products, see how they look or fit, and compare different options. Amazon and Walmart are already leveraging AR to provide immersive shopping experiences with its virtual try-on feature. AR is reshaping our world, and we can expect to see more innovation and adoption in 2024 and beyond. 3) Expect advances in bioprinting artificial tissue and organs Another exciting innovation in healthcare is bioprinting, which is the use of 3D printing to create artificial tissue and organs. Bioprinting could potentially solve the problem of organ shortage and transplant rejection, as well as enable personalized medicine and drug testing. Bioprinting is still in its early stages, but some companies and researchers like those at MIT have already made some impressive progress. AI is truly changing medicine as we know it, and we can expect to see more breakthroughs and applications in 2024 and beyond. 4) Autonomous electric taxi service becomes available One of the most anticipated technologies in 2024 is the autonomous electric taxi service by Zoox, a subsidiary of Amazon. Their tag line is, ""Built for riders - not for drivers."" Zoox has been developing and testing its self-driving vehicles in various cities since 2020, and plans to launch its service in 2024. Zoox’s vehicles are designed to navigate complex urban environments with four-wheel steering, bidirectional driving, and a spacious cabin that can fit four passengers. Zoox’s taxis can be booked through an app or a kiosk, and offer a flat rate per mile. Zoox aims to provide a safer, more efficient, and more comfortable alternative to conventional taxis, and to reduce traffic and pollution. 5) More drone delivery services in the sky The year 2024 is expected to witness significant growth in the use of drone delivery services, especially in urban areas where traffic congestion and pollution are major challenges. Drone delivery services offer a fast, convenient, and eco-friendly way of transporting goods and services to customers, reducing the need for road vehicles and human labor. One of the leading companies in this field is Amazon, which added a third U.S. city that will soon have the option to get their packages delivered by a drone beginning in late 2024. The company's Prime Air has been using drones to safely deliver packages weighing up to five pounds in one hour or less, for almost a year. Prime Air is also unveiling the new MK30 drone design, which the company claims is quieter, smaller, and lighter than previous models. MORE: 5 DRONES EXPERT REVIEWED 6) More 3D-printed houses will go up Forget about hiring an old-fashioned contractor to build your next home. Imagine having a house built by a 3D printer. More and more of these houses are going to be going up in 2024 as a cost-effective and eco-friendly way of constructing houses. A company called ICON is a leader in 3D printing technology for construction, with a mission to revolutionize the way we build and live. They have developed a robotic system that can print an entire house layer by layer, using a durable material called Lavacrete, which is a type of concrete that can withstand extreme weather conditions and natural disasters while also reducing waste and emissions. ICON has already printed several houses around the world, including the first 3D-printed community in Austin, Texas. ICON’s vision is to make 3D printing accessible to everyone and to create homes that are beautiful, functional, and resilient.

According to some experts, electric vehicles (EVs) will account for more than 40% of new car sales in the US by 2024, thanks to the increasing affordability, performance, and environmental benefits of EVs. Whether you’re looking for a budget-friendly Kia Niro, an all-American Ford F-150 Lightning, a futuristic Tesla Cybertruck, a lavish Rolls-Royce Spectre, or a sleek Hyundai IONIQ 6, there’s an EV for everyone. Car sharing is also expected to grow significantly in 2024, as more people opt for convenient and cost-effective transportation solutions. Some of the leading car-sharing platforms, such as Zipcar, Turo, and Getaround, will offer more options for EV rentals, as well as innovative features such as peer-to-peer sharing, autonomous driving, and smart charging. With electric cars and car sharing, the future of transportation looks bright and green in 2024. Kurt's key takeaways As we look ahead to 2024 and beyond, it's clear that the world of technology is poised for exciting transformations. Artificial Intelligence, augmented reality, bioprinting, autonomous electric taxis, drone delivery services, 3D printed houses, and electric cars are all shaping a future that promises greater convenience, sustainability, and innovation. These advancements are not just changing industries; they're revolutionizing the way we live, work, and interact with the world.

175562243,Inverness revellers ring in 2024 with &#8216;World&#8217;s Largest Ceilidh&#8217;,"A huge party in Inverness saw crowds enjoy the “World’s Largest Ceilidh” to ring in 2024, at the Northern Meeting Park. From first-time first footers to impromptu singing the event was deemed a success for organisers, and for the 5,000 people who attended the four-hour-long party. A procession was led through the streets of the city to herald the start of the event at 8.30pm. Headlining were Highland Fire – including singer Calum MacPhail and Sea Cousins from Horo. Norrie MacIver, who sings as a solo artist and with Celtic supergroup Skipinnish, sang in both Gaelic and English to the crowd. BBC Radio 2 Folk Award winner Siobhan Miller brought in the bells with the crowd. Seven minutes of fireworks at Inverness’ ‘World’s Largest Ceilidh’ Ross Ainslie and Ali Hutton provided the backdrop to an incredible seven-minute-long firework display. The crowd even held their own in an impromptu singing of Dolly Parton’s classic “Country Roads”. Ceilidh dancing was also high on the agenda, with revellers enjoying a Strip the Willow and a Dashing White Sergeant as well as many other dances during the night. Among the attendees was Kirstie Kearns, enjoying her first Hogmanay in the Highlands. Originally from Inverness, the 48-year-old nurse grew up on the other side of the world in Australia. Joined by three generations of her family, she welcomed the start of a New Year as part of her festive holidays. Speaking to The P&J, Kirstie, who lives in Darwin, Australia, said she loved the atmosphere, despite the chill in the air. She said: “We are over on holiday with three generations of our family. “I was born here but grew up in Australia, so we come here every five years. “I’ve never been up here for Hogmanay. “I didn’t realise it would be quite this cold, but I love it. It is a great atmosphere.” Kirstie says her hope for 2024 is to “have fun.” Matt Procter was also enjoying his first Hogmanay in the Highland capital surrounded by family. The 40-year-old moved from Essex to Drumnadrochit in March, with his wife and children, to begin a new life in the Highlands. ‘It is amazing’ Matt said the event helped them to celebrate the momentous occasion in style. He said: “It is our first Hogmanay festival, so we thought we would come along and have a look. “We said, what should we do to make it special as it is our first one so we thought why not come and see this, see what it is all about, have a boogie and learn to ceilidh dance. It is amazing.” He said their aim for 2024 is to see more of the Scottish Highlands; their new backyard. Joining Matt was his brother-in-law Aron Rayner, who also relocated with his family to Drumnadrochit. Aron, 39, said they had already begun planning their return next year. He said: “We are actually putting together a list already of who we want to bring up next year for it. We are trying to work out which family members would be able to stick it or not.” The event was also a family affair for Chris Andrew from Ardersier. The 39-year-old, who works as a tarmac layer, danced the night away as he relished in Scotland’s Hogmanay traditions. He said: “It is all about spending time with the family. “The kids are a bit older now so we try to keep them out, let them enjoy the Scottish traditional music and everything it is about; being part of the Highlands. “It is all about making memories. My boy plays the pipes and he keeps saying, ‘That’s what I want to be’, all the time. ‘It has been brilliant’ “It is so good; you’ve got people of so many different ages. It has been brilliant.” Chris joked that his New Year resolution was to drink less and listen to more Scottish music. Fiona Dolan travelled from Alness with her granddaughters to enjoy the evening’s festivities. The 56-year-old church coordinator said: “I turned out because I have two 10-year-old grandaughters. It is great to come as a family. “We were here last year, but I think for the kids the ceilidh is good. Rather than listening, they can get up and dance. “I’m not a tourist, but I also think for tourists, it is quite fun. It gives it a bit of character. A spokesman for the organisers said: “We are delighted with the nearly four thousand guests that joined us to celebrate the bells for what was a new twist on a traditional Inverness Event. “The parade, a new addition to this year’s line up set the tone for what became a memorable night with fire performers, drummers and pipe bands involved. “Revellers were entertained by the highest quality performances from Scotland’s leading traditional music artists and we were amazed at the engagement shown by the audience in joining in the dancing and singing along throughout the evening. “We would like to thank all those who joined us to celebrate Hogmanay, with a special thanks to the public who created a fantastic atmosphere. “We’re looking forward to developing the event for the future and to continue to improve what we can offer in our Events programme supported by the City of Inverness Councillors and the Inverness Common Good Fund.”",https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/inverness/6313332/inverness-2024-worlds-largest-ceilidh/,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Kirstie-Right-behind-pink-hat-pictured-with-her-family-2apnj9p9w-e1704104609490.jpg,2024-01-01 12:03:54,Louise Glen,['Louise Glen'],en,gb,0.785
175586563,Enkuuka Festival: Celebrating Culture Amidst Challenges and Artist Safety Concerns,"The Enkuuka festival, this year was dubbed ‘Enkuuka Tobongoota’ an annual celebration deeply rooted in Ugandan culture organized in the Buganda Kingdom’s place Mengo Enkuuka festival has long been a cornerstone of communal joy, artistic expression, and cultural heritage where artists across the country are given a chance to perform. Dating back to ancient times, this vibrant event has thrived in its ability to unite people through music, dance, and storytelling and people especially Baganda get to learn more about their folks and norms this is through the grand finale of ‘Entanda ya Buganda’ where the winner goes with a plot of land. However, amidst its successes, the festival has faced its share of challenges, particularly in protecting artists from instances of violent humiliation at the hands of the audience. The festival’s triumphs are evident in its ability to preserve traditional Ugandan arts and provide a platform for local talents to showcase their skills. Enkuuka has been instrumental in promoting cultural understanding and fostering a sense of pride among Ugandans, both locally and within the diaspora. Its colourful displays of music and dance serve as a testament to the richness of Uganda’s diverse heritage, drawing crowds from far and wide to partake in this cultural extravaganza. Yet, within this celebration of culture, some unfortunate incidents have marred the festival’s reputation. Shockingly, a few artists have faced violence and humiliation from sections of the audience. In the most recent iteration of the festival, artists like Sheebah Karungi faced significant challenges during their performances, impacting the celebratory transition into the new year for music enthusiasts. Sheebah shared her experience of anticipation, eagerly awaiting her turn to grace the stage. However, as soon as she commenced her performance, technical issues disrupted the sound system, coinciding with disturbances escalating into fights on stage. Despite her efforts to engage the crowd without adequate sound support, the situation became untenable, leading her to eventually leave the stage. Ray G, one of Western Uganda’s esteemed singers, encountered the same distressing situation where his performance was marred by a disturbing incident. As he stepped onto the stage to commence his act, he faced a barrage of objects thrown in his direction, preventing him from completing his performance peacefully. Other artists, like Omukunja Atasera and his partner King Sheebah, also fell victim to the aggression of disgruntled attendees during the same event. They faced a distressing situation as bottles were thrown at them, disrupting their performances and endangering their safety amidst the hostility of the crowd. Despite efforts to create a safe and respectful environment, instances of disrespect and mistreatment toward performers have surfaced, causing distress and raising concerns about the festival’s ability to safeguard its participants. The incidents, often sparked by disagreements or misunderstandings, have underscored the need for improved security measures and increased awareness among attendees about respecting the performers. Ensuring the safety and dignity of artists must be a priority for the festival’s organizers to maintain Enkuuka’s essence as a celebration of cultural expression and unity. Efforts to address these issues include enhanced security protocols, educational initiatives aimed at fostering mutual respect among festival-goers, and collaborative dialogues involving artists, organizers, and the community. These steps are crucial in creating a supportive and secure environment where artists can freely express themselves without fear of mistreatment or humiliation. The Enkuuka festival stands at a crossroads, balancing its achievements in promoting culture with the imperative to address and rectify the incidents tarnishing its reputation. While its successes are evident in its cultural significance and ability to bring people together, the festival must confront its failures in safeguarding artists against violence and humiliation. As the festival evolves, its commitment to cultural celebration and the well-being of its participants must go hand in hand. By fostering an environment of respect and inclusivity, Enkuuka can continue to flourish as a cherished celebration of Ugandan heritage, ensuring that artists are revered and protected during this annual extravaganza. Apart from those few crystals, the Nkuuka Tabongoota was a wonderful success.

175554459,"New year, new job! As Crown Princess Mary of Denmark steps up to become Queen following Margrethe's...","Crown Princess Mary is preparing for her role as Queen, after her mother-in-law shocked the nation when she announced her abdication from the throne in a speech on New Year's Eve. But how the life of the royal - who is originally from Australia - will change is still yet unknown. While the 51-year-old is beloved in the country, and in October 2019 was named regent - which gave her the power perform duties as head of state when Margrethe II was overseas or otherwise engaged - fans will now be excited to see what Mary does with her new role. Yesterday, Queen Margrethe revealed that she would be stepping down as monarch after 52 years. She will be succeeded by her son, Crown Prince Frederik, on January 14. Crown Princess Mary is preparing for her role as Queen, after her mother-in-law shocked the nation when she announced her abdication from the throne in a speech on New Year's Eve. Mary and her husband pictured in November It means his wife Mary, whom he first met at a pub in Sydney, will soon become the world's first Australian-born queen. She was working as an advertising executive when she first met Frederik in a packed city pub 23 years ago and had no idea the handsome European tourist she had been chatting to for hours was actually the future king of Denmark. Now, married for 19 years and proud parents to four children, Mary has won her adopted country over by her dedication to royal duty and her fluency in the language. And despite speculation about the state of the royal couple's marriage over the years, there is nothing concrete to suggest they are anything but happily married. The pair was most recently rocked by rumours after photographs emerged of Frederik, 55, enjoying a night out with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova in Madrid in October. But despite allegations of an 'affair', Frederik and Mary made a show of unity as they headed into Aarhus cathedral on Christmas Eve. Here, FEMAIL looks at what may change - and what may stay the same - in Mary's life as she moves forward into her new role... GUIDANCE FROM HER MOTHER-IN-LAW According to one source from 2021, stepping down has been on Margrethe's mind for quite some time now. Speaking to Woman's Day, the insider explained that the royal had been slowly but surely guiding her daughter-in-law for the duties over the years. Yesterday, Queen Margrethe revealed that she would be stepping down as monarch after 52 years. Pictured with Mary in February 2022 The Danish Queen (right) will be succeeded by her eldest son Crown Prince Frederik (centre) pictured with his Australian-born wife Crown Princess Mary in 2018 'If Margrethe's plan goes ahead, I can imagine it would be an unofficial stepping down, where Mary will still answer to her mother-in-law – it's not altogether different to how things already are,' they said. 'Mary has been taking the reins from Margrethe for a couple of years, she wants to help where she can.' The source added that Mary had 'blossomed' under her mother-in-law's guidance. 'She can finally fulfil her fairytale destiny,' they continued. 'With Margrethe just a short flight away should Mary need her.' Yesterday, Queen Margrethe revealed that she would be stepping down as monarch after 52 years CONTINUING TO CHAMPION CHARITY It is possible that Mary will be encouraged to do more with her foundation following her new role. According to its website, the organisation works to 'fight social isolation based on the belief that everyone has the right to belong'. Initiatives tackle issues including bullying, loneliness and domestic violence. Earlier this month, Mary hinted at her future 'success' and big things to come in a post on the foundation's site and Instagram. The letter was about loneliness and the need for positive human connection during the festive season but offered hints towards something bigger. It is possible that Mary will be encouraged to do more with her foundation following her new role. Pictured during a visit to a school in Denmark in 2022 She added: 'And at the same time, so much has happened that it is impossible to put it all into words.' 'We close 2023 soon and go on Christmas holidays with a gratitude for all that we humans can do when we do it together. We need each other if we are to succeed.' A photo of the royal in the snow was posted alongside the powerful message. She wore a purple jacket beneath a warm woollen wrap and gave a soft smile toward the camera. The royal has also in past shown interest in a number of causes, including humanitarian aid, support for research and science as well as social and health initiatives. Between raising her children and appearing at diplomatic events, Mary has worked tirelessly to prove her commitment to charity, becoming a patron of more than 25 international organisations since her marriage to Frederik in 2004. This includes the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe and the United Nations Population Fund, where she supports their work to promote maternal health in more than 150 developing nations. The royal has also in past shown interest in a number of causes, including humanitarian aid, support for research and science as well as social and health initiatives. Pictured in November According to royal reporter Kenth G. Madsen, Mary will 'play a very prominent role' and 'will not be an invisible queen'. However, he also explained she may, to avoiding straying into political territory, need to be careful with initiatives around women's and children's rights abroad. She and Frederik may also need to encompass causes Margrethe was passionate about, to expand their repertoire - 'so that it is not just the more modern topics'. ENTOURAGE OF FRIENDS? It is not known if Mary will have a new team to advise and support on her new duties as Queen. However, it is likely she will rely on her plethora of tight-knit pals. CAROLINE HEERING Since the Princess married Prince Frederik, Caroline Heering is thought to have been one of her closest friends and confidantes. She has even served as Mary's lady-in-waiting and private secretary. In 2010, Caroline started to dedicate herself to The Mary Foundation, where she occupied the position of official adviser. However, she reportedly stepped down from the board of directors in 2023. It was in 2017 reported that Caroline is married to one of Frederik's childhood friends, Peter, and that the pair have two daughter, Emilie and Rosemarie. TANJA DOKY As Princess Mary's former lady-in-waiting and private secretary, Tanja Doky and the Princess are also understood to have a firm friendship. Tanja worked with the Princess for seven years, eventually leaving Princess Mary to take up a position as communications manager at Maersk Container Industry in 2015. Tanja was married to the famous jazz musician, Chris Minh Doky, and the pair have two children, Frida and Milo. They have since separated, however. BIRGITTE HANDWERK As the partner of one of Prince Frederik's best friends, Jeppe, Birgitte Handwerk was one of Princess Mary's first friends in Denmark. Not only was their friendship formed early on, but they have also shared key experiences over the past decade, insofar as they've both raised young families at the same time. While Birgitte is godmother to Princess Mary's daughter, Josephine, Jeppe is a godfather to her son, Christian. Mary also attended Jeppe and Birgitte's wedding in 2002. VISITING HOME IN AUSTRALIA It is possible that Mary's new duties will affect how often she is able to visit her home in Australia. And the royal appeared very emotional as she wrapped up her pre-Christmas break Down Under earlier this month. Departing from Queenstown Airport in New Zealand after a four-day trip amid a visit to her native Australia, the future Queen appeared to wipe away a tear as she said goodbye to friends and prepared to make the journey back to Denmark. It's not only her homeland, but is also where the royal's love story with her husband began. Mary was 28 years old when she met Frederik in the Slip Inn in Sydney 23 years ago. After the pub encounter, then 32-year-old Fred - who was in Australia to support Denmark's sailing team at the 2000 Olympics - asked Mary for her phone number and a romance blossomed. It is possible that Mary's new duties will affect how often she is able to visit her home in Australia. Pictured in Australia in December 2022 'The first time we met we shook hands. I didn't know he was the prince of Denmark. Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, ""Do you know who these people are""?' Mary revealed in an interview about meeting the heir to the Danish throne. They maintained a long-distance relationship for a year, with Frederik making secret trips Down Under before Mary moved to Denmark to study Danish language at Copenhagen's Studieskolen in 2001. In early 2003, Frederik's mother Queen Margrethe publicly acknowledged the relationship and the couple announced their engagement at Amalienborg Castle later that year on October 8. Frederik and Mary made their first official appearance together at the Tasmania Yacht Club ahead of the Dragon Boat World Championship on January 19, 2003 In a nod to her heritage, during her wedding Mary carried a bouquet of Australian snow gum eucalyptus interspersed with blooms from the Palace garden Frederik and Mary married on May 14, 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral, with the newly minted Crown Princess opting for a beautiful gown by Danish designer Uffer Frank and a veil first used by Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden in 1905. In a nod to her heritage, Mary carried a bouquet of Australian snow gum eucalyptus interspersed with blooms from the Palace garden. The family has returned to Mary's native Australia on many occasions, visiting famous landmarks in Sydney, Canberra and the Northern Territory and even spending Christmas Down Under. ROYAL RESIDENCE Currently, Mary and her family reside in Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg. She and Frederik took over the property from the State in 2010 - when a full refurbishment and restoration was completed after six years. Today, it is their private residence with administrative and ceremonial functions. They also reside at the Chancellery House at Fredensborg Palace. According to royal reporter Kenth G. Madsen, the couple will live in their current accommodation and have no plans to relocate.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12915951/New-year-new-job-Crown-Princess-Mary-Denmark-steps-Queen-following-Margrethes-shock-abdication-Australian-born-royals-life-change.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/01/01/10/79501831-0-image-m-22_1704106050663.jpg,2024-01-01 12:08:38,"Editor, Elmira Tanatarova","['Editor', 'Elmira Tanatarova']",en,gb,0.426
175557089,"DGP, IGP Conference To Be Held In Rajasthan This Week; PM Modi Likely To Attend","New Delhi, Jan 1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend the 58th all-India annual conference of Director Generals and Inspector Generals of Police this week in Rajasthan’s Jaipur to discuss a wide range of issues such as counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency and cyber security. Various other aspects of policing and national security, including strengthening borders, cybercrime, data governance, anti-terrorism challenges, prison reforms, Left-wing extremism or naxalism, and narcotics smuggling, are to be discussed in the conference, in which the Director Generals of Police (DGPs) of different States will present their views in the three-day event scheduled to be held between January 5-7 in different sessions based on separate topics. Sources said that the conference is the culmination of “extensive deliberations involving police and intelligence officers from district, State and national levels on identified themes.” “Best practices from States and Union Territories (UTs) under each of the themes will be presented at the conference so that states can learn from each other,” sources privy to the development said. This would be the first major national conference being held in Jaipur after the formation of the new government in Rajasthan. The National Conference is learnt to be organized at Rajasthan International Center located at Jhalana in Jaipur, said the sources, citing the current schedule. Prime Minister Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Union Ministers of State for Home, National Security Advisor, Union Home Secretary, DGPs and IGPs of States and the UTs, and heads of the Central Police Organisations and Central Armed Police Forces will be present in the conference. About 100 invitees, including DGPs of states and UTs and heads of Central Armed Police Forces and Central Police Organisations, will attend the conference physically, while nearly 600 more officers of various levels are to attend the conference virtually from states and UTs. Since 2014, the Prime Minister has taken a keen interest in the DGP conference. Unlike the symbolic presence of Prime Ministers earlier, PM Modi sits through all major sessions of the conference. The Prime Minister not only listens patiently to all the inputs but also encourages free and informal discussions so that new ideas can come up. This provides a congenial atmosphere for the top police officials of the country to directly brief the Prime Minister on key policing and internal security issues affecting the country and give their open and frank recommendations. Further, guided by the vision of the Prime Minister, the conference has started discussions on futuristic themes in policing and security to ensure not only safety in the present but also to develop a capability to meet emerging issues and challenges. Prime Minister has also encouraged the organisation of annual DGP conferences all across the country since 2014. The conference was organised at Guwahati in 2014; Dhordo, Rann of Kutch in 2015; National Police Academy, Hyderabad in 2016; BSF Academy, Tekanpur in 2017; Kevadiya in 2018; and IISER, Pune in 2019; and at Police Headquarters, Lucknow in 2021; and Delhi in 2022 and 2023. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this conference was organised virtually in 2020. While attending last year’s conference, the Prime Minister suggested making the police forces more sensitive and training them in emerging technologies, emphasising the importance of the National Data Governance Framework for smoothing data exchange across agencies. Prime Minister then stressed the need to further strengthen traditional policing mechanisms like foot patrols while suggesting leveraging technological solutions like biometrics. He then recommended repealing obsolete criminal laws and building standards for police organisations across states, and he suggested prison reforms to improve jail management. The Prime Minister also discussed strengthening border as well as coastal security by organising frequent visits of officials. The Prime Minister then also emphasised enhanced cooperation between state police and central agencies to leverage capabilities and share best practices, and suggested replicating the model of the conference at the state and district levels for discussing emerging challenges and evolving best practices among their teams.

175554473,"Live updates: Israel-Hamas war, Gaza humanitarian crisis","Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are stepping up their strikes on ships in the Red Sea, which they say are revenge against Israel for its military campaign in Gaza. There are fears that the attacks could escalate Israel’s war against Hamas into a wider regional conflict. The US said Sunday that it has no desire to enter a wider war, but that it will act in its own self-defense, after US Navy helicopters sank three Houthi boats that the US says fired on the aircraft in the Red Sea. The helicopters had been responding to a distress call from the latest commercial vessel to come under Houthi fire. The attacks have forced some of the world’s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the world’s most important maritime trade routes, which could potentially cause a shock to the global economy. Here’s what we know about the Houthis: Who are the Houthis? The Houthi movement, also known as Ansarallah (Supporters of God), is one side of the Yemeni civil war that has raged for nearly a decade. It emerged in the 1990s, when its leader, Hussein al-Houthi, launched “Believing Youth,” a religious revival movement for a centuries-old subsect of Shia Islam called Zaidism. His closest followers became known as Houthis. How did they gain power? Ali Abdullah Saleh, the first president of Yemen after the 1990 unification of North and South Yemen, initially supported the Believing Youth. But as the movement’s popularity grew and anti-government rhetoric sharpened, it became a threat to Saleh. Things came to a head in 2003, when Saleh supported the United States invasion of Iraq, which many Yemenis opposed. For al-Houthi, the rift was an opportunity. Seizing on the public outrage, he organized mass demonstrations. After months of disorder, Saleh issued a warrant for his arrest. Al-Houthi was killed in September 2004 by Yemeni forces, but his movement lived on. The Houthi military wing grew as more fighters joined the cause. Emboldened by the early Arab Spring protests in 2011, they took control of the northern province of Saada and called for the end of the Saleh regime. How powerful are the Houthis? American officials have been tracking iterative improvements in the range, accuracy and lethality of the Houthis’ domestically produced missiles. Initially, homegrown Houthi weapons were largely assembled with Iranian components smuggled into Yemen in pieces, an official familiar with US intelligence told CNN previously. But they have made modifications that have added up to big overall improvements, the official said. In a novel development, the Houthis have used medium-range ballistic missiles against Israel, firing a salvo of projectiles at Israel’s southern region of Eilat in early December. Israel said it intercepted the missiles. While the Houthis may not be able to pose a serious threat to Israel, their technology can wreak havoc in the Red Sea. They have used drones and anti-ship missiles to target commercial ships — some of which aren’t believed to be linked to Israel — prompting US Navy and other warships in the Red Sea to respond to distress calls.",https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-01-01-24/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/231228144827-gaza-civilians-swarm-convoy-1228-super-tease.jpg,2024-01-01 12:15:52,Jessie Yeung,['Jessie Yeung'],en,us,0.126
175563391,PGA Tour confirms talks with LIV and DP World Tour extended into 2024,"Negotiations between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) have been extended beyond the original deadline of 31 December. A framework agreement between the organisations, which stunned the world of men’s professional golf, was announced on 6 June and was initially intended to be concluded before the end of 2023. Discussions have been complicated by the emergence of interest from private equity groups, with the PGA Tour announcing on 10 December that it was in discussions with Strategic Sports Group (SSG), an investment group headlined by Liverpool FC’s owner, Fenway Sports Group. In a memo to players sent on 31 December, the PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, said “meaningful progress” had been made with SSG and “productive conversations” continued with the DP World Tour and PIF, which bankrolls the breakaway LIV Golf circuit. “I wanted to provide an update on our negotiations with Strategic Sports Group, the Public Investment Fund and DP World Tour,” Monahan wrote. “As you know, the [PGA Tour policy] board unanimously directed management to pursue exclusive negotiations with SSG. I am pleased to report that we have made meaningful progress and have provided SSG with the due diligence information they requested.” He continued: “As we move forward in our discussions, we are focused on the finalisation of terms and drafts of necessary documents. We also continue our active and productive conversations with PIF and the DP World Tour. While we had initially set a deadline of 31 December 2023 to reach an agreement, we are working to extend our negotiations into next year based on the progress we have made to date. “Our goal for 2024 is to reach agreements with SSG, PIF and the DP World Tour, bringing them on board as minority co-investors in PGA Tour Enterprises. These partnerships will allow us to unify, innovate and invest in the game for the benefit of players, fans and sponsors.” LIV Golf secured a major coup with the signing of Masters champion Jon Rahm on a multimillion-dollar deal last month, despite the world No 3 having previously insisted he was not interested in jumping ship.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/01/pga-tour-confirm-talks-with-dp-world-tour-and-liv-extended-into-2024,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb6d5ceebdb7591a71d9b6662aa3b7de7ac85913/0_175_5279_3169/master/5279.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV,2024-01-01 12:17:18,"Liverpool FC, PA Media","['Liverpool FC', 'PA Media']",en,us,0.25
175556823,New year: Fireworks and street parties ring in 2024 across UK,"The UK marked the beginning of 2024 with fireworks, street parties and a message of inclusivity as people celebrated across Britain. As Big Ben struck midnight drones lit up the London sky with the message ""London, a place for everyone"", before a vibrant firework display began. About 100,000 people gathered to watch the 15-minute spectacular in the city. In Scotland, Britpop band Pulp performed as thousands braved the cold to mark Hogmanay. There was also a firework display as Edinburgh marked its 30th year of the celebrations, while there was a mass ceilidh staged in Inverness. London's display included more than 12,000 fireworks, 600 drones and 430 lights. It quoted Shakespeare, heard from the King and also paid homage to the NHS, which celebrated 75 years in 2023. A quote from King Charles was used to mark the 75th anniversary of the Windrush crossing in which he said new arrivals ""collectively enrich the fabric of our national life"". Further messages throughout the show were heard from Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, Dame Helen Mirren, Bella Ramsey, Stephen Fry, Joanna Lumley, George the Poet, and Baroness Floella Benjamin, who read a poem by the late Benjamin Zephaniah. The celebration will continue later with a New Year's Day parade beginning in Piccadilly at midday before making its way over to Westminster's Parliament Square. Several days of weather warnings did not put off revellers in Scotland with tens of thousands watching Edinburgh's firework display. Visitors from more than 80 countries gathered in the city, while Pulp headlined a concert in Princes Street Gardens. Following the fireworks thousands continued to celebrate, signing Auld Lang Syne and dancing. Inverness was host to the Red Hot Highland Fling, described by organisers as ""one of the biggest ceilidhs on the planet"", where folk singer Siobhan Miller entertained partygoers up to midnight. Later, hundreds of hardy swimmers are expected to brave the waters of the Firth of Forth as part of the annual Loony Dook - dook being a Scots word for dip or bathe. People are encouraged to don fancy dress for the charity swim. In Allendale, Northumberland, the annual Allendale Tar Bar'l ceremony was held. The centuries-old tradition sees 45 local men carry burning whiskey barrels through the town. Before the celebrations King Charles and Queen Camilla waved to onlookers as they attended the New Year's Eve service at a church in Sandringham, Norfolk. Ahead of giving his New Year message the Archbishop of Canterbury urged politicians not to treat their opponents as enemies but as fellow human beings. He told the BBC our capacity ""to disagree deeply and not destructively"" is cause for hope. His message will be broadcast on BBC1 and iPlayer at 12:55 GMT. In his New Year message Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hinted at tax cuts in an election year and said the UK should ""look forward with pride and optimism"". He said his resolution would be to ""keep driving forward"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used his message to say that while it had been ""another tough year economically for millions of people"" hope was ""the fuel of change"".

175557227,"LP, APC trade words over Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation","The leadership of the Labour Party has labelled the reported ‘mechanical completion’ and the ‘flare start-off’ of the country’s biggest crude refinery in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital, as a sham. This was even as the ruling All Progressives Congress cautioned the Labour Party against misleading the public, stressing that it is not every issue that should be politicised. The development comes one week after the Federal Government, through the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Heineken Lokpobiri, announced the near-completion of the Port Harcourt refinery during a media tour on the penultimate Thursday. The two-unit refinery has a combined refining capacity of 210,000 barrels per day, with the old plant having an output of 60,000 barrels per day and the new plant churning out 150,000 bpd. But the leadership of the Labour Party thinks otherwise, insisting that it was another ploy by the APC government to allegedly pull a wool over the faces of Nigerians. In an exclusive chat with our correspondent, the Chief Spokesman for the Labour Party Campaign Organisation, Yunusa Tanko, claimed the party has it on good authority that the start-off of the plant as being reported was stage-managed. He said, “We hear that they have completed the mechanical works. This particular gas flare in Port Harcourt refinery is a deceit. It is another lie to deceive the Nigerian people. We used to know that once we began to have gas flaring up, some oil would be produced at the same time. “But in this case, there is no single oil drop. That’s why we are saying this particular gas flaring they are trying to make everyone talk about is deceit. There was nothing like that. They have not been able to work on that refinery conclusively. It is a lie. “If they are sure about the fact, let them prove us wrong. What happened is that some people just went and switched on the power generator to start up that particular gas flaring to deceive the Nigerian people.” Reacting to the development, Deputy National Organising Secretary of the APC, Nze Chidi Duru, appealed for understanding, saying the operation of the Port Harcourt refinery is a privately funded project, which has nothing to do with the FG. Duru also warned opposition parties to always engage in constructive criticisms with a view to proffering solutions to the myriad problems in the country instead of seeking to score cheap points against the government of the day. “It (refinery) is working and functional. But it has nothing to do with the government because it is a private sector-led initiative. So if the FG has made an announcement that it is working, we have every reason it will work. If it doesn’t work, they know it will damage their brand, and people may no longer believe them. “But as I said earlier, it has nothing to do with the APC government. It is Indorama Petrochemicals that is behind it and not the Federal Government. That was why I said it is not everything we should play politics with in this country. It is a private sector-led initiative,” he stated.",https://punchng.com/lp-apc-trade-words-over-port-harcourt-refinery-rehabilitation/,https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/11111123/APC-and-LP-party-logos.jpg,2024-01-01 12:17:51,"Adebayo Folorunsho, Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis","['Adebayo Folorunsho', 'Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis']",en,ng,-0.679
175556777,"Evgenia Timofeenko, CEO of REA Mayak: What Main Tasks Real Estate Investments Solve","Investing money can be done in various ways, ranging from buying stocks and cryptocurrency to investing in businesses, among others. However, investing in real estate is often considered the most reliable and conservative option. To minimize the risks of losing capital, it is advisable to not only use high-risk instruments but also more stable ones. With the right approach, the latter can give a good return as well. Evgenia Timofeenko, the owner and CEO of АН Mayak Real Estate, shares more about the features and benefits of investing in foreign real estate. Capital preservation through real estate investment ""Our agency's clients include both experienced and novice investors. Many of them invest money in different instruments, diversifying risks. When there is an opportunity to withdraw a sufficiently large amount of money from risky instruments, they buy real estate, as it belongs to more stable instruments. And we are always happy to help you choose a profitable object, so that a stable instrument will also continue to bring good income"" - shares Evgenia Timofeenko Real estate investing plays an important role in capital preservation. Investors can buy highly liquid properties that can be sold quickly at a good price. Generally, such properties are located in the city center, near attractions, universities, the seaside, and other important infrastructure. Capital appreciation through the purchase of foreign real estate Real estate investments can provide an opportunity for capital appreciation. The strategy typically involves purchasing a property during the excavation stage and selling it upon or shortly after completion. This investment approach can yield returns of 20% to 100% annually, depending on the type of property selected. Moreover, many foreign developers offer installment plans without appreciation, which is advantageous for investors. ""Installment payment without appreciation is a great solution for many investors who cannot pay the entire amount at once when buying an apartment. For example, the housing costs 100 000 dollars and it is necessary to pay 35-70% of the cost at once, and the rest can be paid over several years (maybe until the end of construction or a couple of years). The investor immediately pays a minimum of 35 000 dollars and within 1 year, for example, pays another 20 000 dollars, that is, in fact, invests 55 thousand. After that the house is put into operation and the apartment is sold for 150 000 dollars. In fact, the investor earns 50 000. If you calculate the return on the invested capital, you get 100% per annum,""- Evgeniya gives an example. Obtaining passive income from renting out real estate By investing in real estate you can solve such a problem as passive income. The object can be rented out on a long-term or daily basis When you rent out a residential property abroad for a long period of time, you can earn a minimum of 7% per year. The most important thing is to select the right apartment or house. If you have a good object in a good location, you can earn up to 15% per year by renting it out on a daily basis When buying apartments or villas to rent out, it is best to choose an agency that has its own management company. The investor can live in another country, while his foreign real estate will be handled by specialists: look for clients, run advertising, control payment and solve many other organizational issues. This significantly saves time and nerves for the homeowner. Choosing a real estate object for investment ""If an investor has already decided on a country, we help him or her find a number of profitable objects to invest in. The staff of our Mayak Real Estate agency can also select offers in different countries, if the future investor does not yet have an understanding of where to go. When making a choice, we take into account the budget and the purpose of investment - preservation or multiplication of capital, obtaining passive income. We can also take into account parallel objectives, for example, if the investor wants the apartment to be a backup in case of children's education abroad,""- says Evgenia Timofeenko. The choice of countries for investing in real estate is wide. The most interesting options for potential investors are the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Bali, Thailand, Montenegro, Spain, USA, UK, Portugal. In each of these countries you can find profitable objects from developers for purchase and resale, as well as for purchase and lease for short or long term. If the task is to buy two or more objects for investment, the best solution - diversification, that is, invest in real estate in different countries. It's best to work with the same agent when choosing a property for resale. This ensures that the specialist selects highly liquid options, which sell quickly and at a good price. Determining the purpose of investment is crucial when choosing a property.

According to the indictment brought in the Tel Aviv District Court, defendant Roi Yifrah never served in the Israeli military, but nonetheless managed to make his way into the war zones by pretending to be a member of an elite Shin Bet security service combat unit.

Channel 12 News aired a photograph of what it said was the 35-year-old posing with other soldiers alongside Netanyahu at a helicopter landing site in full battle gear. An Israeli official confirmed that Yifrah had posed with Netanyahu, but said the prime minister was never at risk due to ""several layers of security at the site."" The Prime Minister's Office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

175563371,Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus convicted of violating Bangladesh’s labour laws,"Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has been convicted of violating Bangladesh’s labour laws in a case decried by his supporters as politically motivated. The 83-year-old is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank, but has earned the enmity of Sheikh Hasina, the longtime prime minister who has accused him of “sucking blood” from poor people. Hasina has made several scathing verbal attacks against the internationally respected 2006 Nobel peace prize winner, who was once seen as a political rival. Yunus and three colleagues from Grameen Telecom, one of the firms he founded, were accused of violating labour laws when they allegedly failed to create a workers’ welfare fund in the company. On Monday, a labour court in the capital, Dhaka, convicted and sentenced them to “six months’ simple imprisonment”, lead prosecutor Khurshid Alam Khan told Agence France-Presse, adding that all four were immediately granted bail pending appeals. All four deny the charges. “I have been punished for a crime that I haven’t committed,” Yunus told reporters after the hearing. “If you want to call it justice, you can.” “This verdict is unprecedented,” said Abdullah Al Mamun, a lawyer for Yunus. “We did not get justice.” Yunus is facing more than 100 other charges over labour law violations and alleged graft. He told reporters after one of the hearings last month that he had not profited from any of the more than 50 social business firms he had set up in Bangladesh. “They were not for my personal benefit,” Yunus said. Another of his lawyers, Khaja Tanvir, said the case was “meritless, false and ill-motivated”. He said: “The sole aim of the case is to harass and humiliate him in front of the world.” Irene Khan, a former Amnesty chief now working as a UN special rapporteur who was present at Monday’s verdict, said the conviction was “a travesty of justice”. “A social activist and Nobel laureate who brought honour and pride to the country is being persecuted on frivolous grounds,” she said. In August, 160 global figures, including former US president Barack Obama and ex-UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, published a joint letter denouncing “continuous judicial harassment” of Yunus. The signatories, including more than 100 of his fellow Nobel laureates, said they feared for his safety and freedom. Critics accuse Bangladeshi courts of rubber-stamping decisions made by Hasina’s government, which is all but certain to win another term in power next week at elections boycotted by the opposition. Her administration has been increasingly firm in its crackdown on political dissent, and Yunus’s popularity among the Bangladeshi public has for years earmarked him as a potential rival. Amnesty International accused the government of “weaponising labour laws” when Yunus went to trial in September and called for an immediate end to his “harassment”. Criminal proceedings against Yunus were “a form of political retaliation for his work and dissent”, the organisation said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/01/nobel-laureate-muhammad-yunus-convicted-bangladesh,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fae60b0e2847d1ea6a8209c25f169651420abbe0/0_329_4932_2959/master/4932.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV,2024-01-01 12:22:52,Agence France-Presse in Dhaka,['Agence France-Presse in Dhaka'],en,us,-0.269

According to the data uploaded on the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) website, 7,473 candidates, including 7,028 male and 445 female candidates, submitted their nominations for the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The Returning Officers (ROs) accepted nominations of 6,449 candidates including 6,094 male and 355 female candidates, and rejected the documents of 1,024 candidates, including 934 men and 90 women. The data on rejected candidates was not provided in detail but jailed former prime minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has claimed that a vast majority of rejections were against its nominated candidates. Similarly, the ROs approved 16,262 nomination papers for the four provincial assemblies, out of the documents submitted by 18,478 candidates, including 17,670 males and 808 females. Nomination papers of 2,216 candidates, including 2,081 men and 135 women, failed to get the approval of ROs for provincial assemblies. Overall, the 22,711 nomination papers for NA and provincial assemblies general seats have been approved, the ECP said, adding that 21,684 of them are men and 1,027 women. A total of 25,951 papers were submitted, while nomination papers of 3,240 candidates, including 3,015 male candidates and 225 females, were rejected. The ECP provided that data of accepted candidates after a five-day scrutiny stage which ended December 30. The rejected candidates can file appeals by January 3 against the decisions of the ROs in the appellate bench of the respective high courts. The appeals will be decided upon by the ECP’s Appellate Tribunal by January 10, followed by subsequent publication of the revised list of candidates January 11. PTI chief Imran Khan is among the candidates whose papers have been rejected. However, leading papers of the leading candidates of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), including Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, Shehbaz Sharif, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari have been accepted. Affected parties can also challenge accepted nominations and in one such case the acceptance of PML-N chief Sharif’s nomination papers from Lahore’s constituency NA-130 for the upcoming February 8. Advocate Ishtiaq Ahmed Samsialvi, who also goes by Ishtiaq Chaudhry, the chief organiser of Pakistan Awami Mahaz‘s (PAM) lawyers’ wing, filed an appeal before the Lahore High Court’s appellate tribunal under Section 63 (appeal against scrutiny order) of the Elections Act 2017. He is also a candidate for NA-130 and challenged the rejection of his nomination papers as well. In his petition, the PAM leader urged the tribunal to strike down the acceptance of Nawaz’s papers as “illegal and unlawful” and that the papers be rejected due to his 2017 disqualification in the Panama Papers case, which the Supreme Court ruled was for The elections will be held February 8 and the preparation has been going as per the schedule.

The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) will host 23 major competitions over the year. With the athletics qualifying window for the Paris 2024 Olympics, scheduled in July-August, already in effect, the events in the first half of the year will also be crucial for the Indian athletes looking to secure a quota for the Paris Olympics. While Indian athletes will be involved in various international athletics meets this year, competing at home under familiar conditions will give them a better chance of breaching the Olympic qualifying standards or improving their rankings in their respective events. The Paris 2024 qualification and ranking period for all individual events - other than the marathon - will run till June 30. The qualification period for the marathon is till April 30, 2024. Indian track and field athletes can hope for a busy month in March with the India Open 400m, jumps and throws competitions on the agenda, in addition to the inaugural National Open Relay Carnival in Chandigarh.

175562231,"Not our job to win referendums for the government, says chief exec of new electoral authority","THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE of Ireland’s new electoral authority has emphasised that it is not its job to win referendums for the government, as Ireland plans to hold every type of poll there is in the next 20 months. Two referendums are to be held in March on whether the Irish constitution should be changed to provide for a wider concept of family, and on whether to delete a reference to the role and duties of women in the home and replace it with a new article on carers. Local authority and European Parliament elections are to be held in June and a general election could be called in 2024 – although ministers have emphasised that they want the coalition to run its full term to the spring of 2025. Added to that is the presidential election in 2025, the Seanad elections and several by-elections, as well as a new vote on a directly elected mayor for Limerick city. The Electoral Commission, which was established in February 2023 after 30 years of governments suggesting the idea, is to provide information on and encourage people to engage in elections and referendums. While acknowledging the challenges ahead, including on how to tackle disinformation, chief executive of the Electoral Commission Art O’Leary is not worried about resources. He hopes to encourage people who are fed up with politicians to use their vote. “We need to be eye-wateringly ambitious,” he told the PA news agency a day after moving into new offices. “I like to look at them (the series of elections) as a glorious opportunity for learning and to collect data. “We’re kicking off a longitudinal study of electoral events which is to last, I’m projecting, for the next 25 years. “We don’t know why people don’t vote and we don’t really know what the turnout rate is. “We need to understand why people vote the way they do, and we need to understand if they have enough information to be able to cast their vote – we have no information on this.” Once the Bill on the referendum wording passes both houses of the Oireachtas, the commission will formally launch its campaign to explain in layman’s terms what the government is proposing. The campaign will involve encouraging people to ensure they are on the electoral register, giving information about the referendum wording and then encouraging people to go out to use their vote on the day. O’Leary said 16-page booklets will be delivered to two million households across the country, at least a week ahead of the plebiscites on Friday 8 March. Although the referendums are being proposed by the government, O’Leary emphasised that the commission was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas. O’Leary said that it is “politically blind” to political parties and its job is to be “independent and impartial”. Art O'Leary PA PA “Our job isn’t to win this referendum for the government. Our job is simply to explain to the people what the referendum is all about, and people can make up their own mind. This is what democracy is all about,” he said. The Electoral Commission does not yet have the powers to act in relation to online political advertising, disinformation or misinformation in time for the referendums in March, and possibly not in time for the summer elections. Though those powers are contained in parts four and five of Bill, they have yet to be commenced, O’Leary said. But other powers the commission has may allow it to act on something that “is not right”. Asked what would happen if there is incorrect information on a poster, O’Leary said they would not be able to take down the posters as their powers relate to online information only, but they could release a statement to set the record straight. “We’ll call it out, I think that’s probably as much as we can do,” he said. Asked whether they would consider setting up a disinformation register, as Australia’s Electoral Commission has, he said: “We may do, it’s certainly an option. “It is our job to provide trusted information to people and if we’re calling out disinformation and saying ‘what this person is saying, or what these people are saying is simply not correct’, then we may look at putting that on our website in a single place where people can go.” He added: “The challenge for us is speed. During the white-hot heat of an election campaign, we don’t have time to sit back and luxuriate about whether something is misinformation or disinformation or not, because hours or even minutes might be important here. “And this is why we need to build an organisation that is flexible enough and responsive enough to be able to manage those challenges. “The technical challenge is we’ll still be writing the review of the referendum electoral experience during the local and European Parliament one, so the opportunity to learn from one to another won’t be maximised. “We can’t look at this in isolation, the next two years are going to be extraordinarily busy, we accept that, but we’re building an organisation that’s going to last 100 years. “People look back at the elections in 1981 and 1982, we had three general elections in 18 months then and the ceiling didn’t fall in – we’ll manage it.” He added: “I’m not concerned about resources. We have enough people to do what we need to do for the moment, anyway.” O’Leary, who has a five-year contract in the role, spent seven years as secretary general to the President of Ireland and 20 years in Leinster House in various civil servant roles. He designed the model for Citizens’ Assemblies and has run three of the six held to date, and advised on the others. Asked about disillusioned parts of the electorate, he said: “I was at the Citizens’ Assembly on drug use during the summer, and one of the speakers there was a man who worked in an addiction treatment centre treating addicts. “He said something that profoundly affected my thinking about this whole issue. He said ‘there is no such thing as hard to reach people or hard to reach groups, there are only hard to reach services’. “So I think that we’ve been looking at this issue from the wrong end of the telescope for a long time – and we might say, ‘How will we get them to come to us?’. That’s not the challenge – we have to be in their communities. “So we need to be on TikTok. We need to be on social media. We need to be telling the story in a way that appeals to young people and Travellers and immigrants and all of the people who are disillusioned and disengaged.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/electoral-commission-polls-referendums-6261710-Jan2024/,https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6261710/river/?height=400&version=6261711,2024-01-01 12:26:12,View all articles,['View all articles'],en,ie,0.079
175557217,Israel to pull some troops from Gaza as war enters new phase,"Israel is withdrawing some forces from Gaza to shift to more targeted operations against Hamas, and is partially returning reservists to civilian life to help the economy as the war looks set to last well into the new year, an Israeli official said. The official said toppling the Islamist faction remained an objective of the offensive in the Palestinian enclave, and that some of the five brigades withdrawn will prepare for a possible flare-up of a second front against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Since launching the war in retaliation for the cross-border Hamas rampage of Oct. 7, Israeli officials have said they would wage it in three main stages. The first was intense shelling to clear access routes for ground forces and encourage civilians to evacuate. The second was the invasion that began on Oct. 27. With tanks and troops having now overrun much of the Gaza Strip, largely asserting control despite Palestinian gunmen continuing their ambushes from hidden tunnels and bunkers, the military is moving to the third stage, said the official, who could not be named in print given the sensitivity of the issue. ""This will take six months at least, and involve intense mopping-up missions against the terrorists. No one is talking about doves of peace being flown from Shajaia,"" the official told Reuters, referring to a Gaza district ravaged by fighting. In addition to the 1,200 people killed on Oct. 7, Hamas took some 240 hostage. Israel is also determined to recover the 129 still held in Gaza. Qatari- and Egyptian-mediated truce efforts have raised the prospect of some of them being freed. The shift appeared to correspond to pressure from Israel's top ally, the United States, to review tactics and do more to protect non-combatants. BOLSTERING ECONOMY Israel initially drafted 300,000 reservists - some 10% to 15% of its workforce - for what looks set to be its longest-ever war. Government sources have said between 200,000 and 250,000 reservists were still mobilised and absent from jobs or studies. The official said two of the brigades being withdrawn were made up of reservists, and described the move as designed to ""re-energise the Israeli economy"". Local media have reported that several military divisions were deployed throughout Gaza. The official added that some of the troops pulled out of Gaza in the south would be prepared for rotation to the northern border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has warned that, if Hezbollah does not back down, a full-on Lebanon war looms. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range attacks against Israel. ""The situation on the Lebanese front will not be allowed to continue. This coming six-month period is a critical moment,"" the official said, adding that Israel would convey a similar message to a U.S. envoy conducting shuttle missions to Beirut. In Gaza, the Israel-Hamas war has inflicted unprecedented devastation, with the health ministry reporting almost 22,000 fatalities, many of them civilian. Israel says it has killed more than 8,000 Palestinian fighters - suggesting that, by its own accounting, Hamas retains core personnel. Pre-war Israeli assessment were that the group had around 30,000 fighters. The Israeli military announced on Saturday it was sending some reservists home as part of what top commander Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi has deemed a ""reconfiguration"" of forces. ""From the first moments of this war, we said it would take long,"" Halevi told troops on Tuesday. ""Will we ultimately be able to say there are no more foes around the State of Israel? I think that is overly ambitious. But we will deliver a different security situation - safe and, as much as possible, stable too."" Israel has listed 174 soldiers - many of them reservists - as killed in Gaza fighting and nine on the Lebanese border.",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/israel-to-pull-some-troops-from-gaza-as-war-enters-new-phase-9090580/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/israel-1.jpg,2024-01-01 12:28:50,,[],en,in,-0.345
175573679,"Legal pot, abortion rights and paid leave: A whirlwind year at the Minnesota Legislature","By late last spring, the rush of headlines coming out of Minnesota’s Capitol seemed like it might never stop. Marijuana legalization. Paid family and medical leave. New legal protections for abortion. Universal school meals. Free college tuition. A mandate for a new state flag. Minnesota’s whirlwind 2023 legislative session is likely to go down as one of the most consequential in a generation. And while some of the new laws have already gone into effect, the impacts of many of the new policies won’t be seen for years. In November 2022, voters gave the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party majorities in both the Senate and House, and another four-year term to DFL Gov. Tim Walz, clearing the path for a sweeping agenda held back by years of divided government. With little leverage, Republicans who had once controlled the Senate could only sit back and watch as members of the DFL “trifecta” swiftly pursued their agenda. So much new legislation was enacted it might be tough to remember everything that happened at the Capitol this year. Here’s a look back at what went down: Abortion One of the first major bills of 2023 made it to the governor’s desk in the first month of the session. The Protect Reproductive Options Act, or PRO ACT, codified the right to abortion in state law. Later in the year, lawmakers removed restrictions such as a 24-hour wait period and parental disclosure requirement from statute. Juneteenth Minnesota now recognizes Juneteenth, the celebration of the end of slavery in the United States, as a state holiday. June 19th became a federal holiday in 2021. Clean energy A bill signed into law in February will require Minnesota to shift all its electricity to carbon-free sources by 2040. Felon voting rights More than 50,000 people with felony convictions on supervised release in Minnesota are now eligible to vote under a new state law. Secretary of State Steve Simon, the state’s top elections official, said it was Minnesota’s “largest single act of enfranchisement” since the voting age changed from 21 to 18 half a century ago. In February the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the felon voting ban. Justices acknowledged the disparate impact but ruled the law was still constitutional, sending the issue back to the Legislature. Felons could start registering to vote on June 1 and the law has so far survived challenges from a conservative legal group. 'Driver's Licenses For All' After a two-decade ban, more than 80,000 Minnesota residents who are in the U.S. illegally will be able to obtain a driver’s license again. The “Driver’s Licenses For All” bill, which removed the requirement for license applicants to provide proof of citizenship or lawful presence in the country, went into effect Oct. 1. Catalytic converters Lawmakers moved to address an explosion in catalytic converter thefts from vehicles. It’s now a crime to remove a catalytic converter from a vehicle without labeling it with the vehicle identification number. Universal school meals As of the beginning of the school year, Minnesota K-12 students started getting school meals at no charge. The program was estimated to cost about $200 million a year, but with more students participating than originally expected, it’s already going to cost $81 million more than planned by the end of 2025. In 2026-2027 it could cost $95 million more, according to state budget officials. LGBT youth Minnesota now protects transgender youth access to treatments like hormone replacements, therapy and other procedures known as gender-affirming care. So-called conversion therapy, treatments aimed at changing a person’s sexual orientation, is no longer permitted for minors in Minnesota. Elections bill A significant number of Minnesotans will now be automatically registered to vote in future elections. And 16- and 17-year-olds will be eligible to preregister to vote. The state now also has new penalties for spreading election disinformation. In addition, the “Democracy for the People Act” signed into law in May creates new independent campaign spending requirements and restricts “foreign-influenced” corporations from contributing to campaigns, though that provision has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Free college tuition Under the new higher education budget, students from families earning less than $80,000 a year are now eligible for free public college tuition after federal aid and grants. PFAS ban Chemicals known as PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, were already banned in food packaging but will be banned from a wider range of products in the coming years. They’re called “forever chemicals” because they build up in organisms and persist in the environment. Sick time On Jan. 1, nearly all Minnesota workers are entitled to 48 hours of leave each year for health and safety reasons. Under the law, employers must allow employees to earn at least one hour of paid safe and sick time for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours per year. The law covers all employees, including part-time and temporary workers. Gun control Universal background checks for firearm sales are now required in Minnesota. And if a person is deemed dangerous by authorities or immediate family, a court can issue an order to take their guns away through an “extreme risk protection order.” Infrastructure With just days left in the session, Minnesota lawmakers approved a $2.6 billion public infrastructure borrowing bill. The bonding will help pay for roads, water treatment plants and public buildings. Biggest ever surplus, budget Minnesota had a record $17.5 billion budget surplus in the beginning of 2023, and by May the governor and DFL lawmakers had put together a record $72 billion budget that raised spending by close to 38% percent over the previous biennial budget. “It’s going to mean a fairer, more inclusive, better and more prosperous Minnesota,” Walz said when he signed the budget's major components into law. “We’re leaving no one behind.” Republicans decried the big spending boost and billions in new taxes despite the surplus. By the end of the year, state budget officials said the state has a $2.4 billion surplus, but warned of shortfalls ahead if the state isn’t careful about spending. Rebates In May the governor signed a tax bill authorizing $1.1 billion in one-time tax rebates for more than 2 million Minnesotans. In the end, total payments came in below $1 billion. In November, the Minnesota Department of Revenue reissued nearly 150,000 one-time tax rebate checks that went uncashed or had expired. Single filers earning up to $75,000 a year were eligible for $260 checks, joint filers earning up to $150,000 were eligible for $520 checks, and households got $260 for each dependent up to three. A married couple with three children could receive up to $1,300. Transportation taxes Minnesota’s per-gallon gasoline tax is expected to go up by 5 cents by 2027, vehicle registration fees are going up, and each delivery will now have a 50-cent fee – though with some exceptions such as for medication. Paid family and medical leave Minnesota is on its way to creating a tax-funded, state-administered paid family and medical leave program for workers. A state program in the works will offer 12 weeks of family leave and 12 weeks of medical leave with a 20-week annual cap. All businesses would be required to participate or offer equivalent benefits. Benefits start in 2026. Legal marijuana Minnesota legalized recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older this year, making it the 23rd state to do so. The state will also expunge marijuana convictions, and create new regulations for the substance. Possession and small-scale growing became legal on Aug. 1, but it will take longer for dispensaries to open. New state flag Minnesota got a new state flag and seal this year. State lawmakers passed a bill creating a commission to explore options that wrapped up its work in December. They’ll become official on statehood day, May 11, unless the Legislature intervenes.",https://www.twincities.com/2024/01/01/minnesota-legislature-review-legal-pot-abortion/,https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AP23144588017665.jpg?w=1024,2024-01-01 12:29:23,Alex Derosier,['Alex Derosier'],en,us,-0.333

But he chose to retire from politics.Lately, the Election Commission of Pakistan, batting for the establishment, declared PTI’s intra-party elections null and void for not complying with the Elections Act and the party’s own constitution. A list of registered parties released by the EC removed the name of Imran Khan as PTI’s party head and shows PTI as a leaderless party. Further, the electoral watchdog stripped PTI of its symbol: a cricket bat.Cancelling the poll symbol would deprive the party of the reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. On 26 December, the Peshawar High Court passed an order reinstating PTI’s election symbol. Instead of adhering to the high court’s directive, the EC has filed a review petition with the court. The petition is scheduled to be reviewed on 9 January.Imran Khan Re-Arrest: A Case Of Overconfidence Trumping Political MileageIn spite of all the roadblocks being placed before PTI, the party remains popular with the masses.Feeling the nerve of the people, the establishment and its caretaker government are leaving no stone unturned to try and ensure a two-thirds majority for Nawaz Sharif’s party. Pakistani social media is abuzz with reports of Army Chief General Syed Asim Munir's meeting with the chairman of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), the government agency responsible for issuing National Identity Cards to Pakistani citizens. The Army Chief is supposed to have given directions to create a minimum of 15,000 bogus votes in each of the 266 parliamentary constituencies by issuing counterfeit voter identification cards made in the name of deceased voters and overseas Pakistanis – 99% of who never exercise their voting right. Data is also available on resident Pakistanis who have been issued voter cards but never vote. Duplicate cards will be made for such voters and given to collaborators for possible use. It is said that the chairman of NADRA, unhappy with these instructions, leaked the details of the meeting.Nawaz Sharif's Return: Pakistan is Unlikely to Break Out of Its Praetorian TrapWhile making sure that there is no level playing field for the PTI, the government continues to dole out unfair advantages to other major parties. On 30 December, the Central Power Purchasing Agency released Rs 74 billion to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) – many of which are owned by the Sharif family and the Zardari group. There are 42 IPPs in Pakistan – 14 of which belong to powerful political families with retired military officers or their family members as partners. These 14 companies rule the roost. They have monopolised licences to import Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) and Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). The very same companies also hold licences for the export and import of wheat and sugar. No new company can get a licence for LNG or LPG import or the import/export of sugar and wheat. The release of funds by the government to IPPs will further strengthen the election war chest of the Sharifs and Zardaris. The establishment has clearly ganged up against the PTI.Given the surge in public sympathy for Imran Khan and his party, the PTI may still turn the tables on the establishment.Leading the PTI is Barrister Gohar Ali Khan who, abandoning the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), joined PTI in July 2022. A fellow Huskie from the University of Washington Law School, he is not widely known in political circles. He is also said to lack ""dynamism” – which should suit Imran.Even the parties opposing PTI do not seem to be confident of victory. Aitzaz Ahsan, a veteran political observer in Pakistan, has predicted that Nawaz Sharif will leave the country before the elections and watch the results unfold from abroad.(Akhil Bakshi a Fellow of Royal Geographical Society, Fellow of Explorers Club USA, and Editor of Indian Mountaineer, has authored 27 books including three on Tibet: Silk Road on Wheels, Train to Lhasa, and Stairway to Heaven.

175559123,Study Abroad: Top scholarship programmes for Indian students,"Ashutosh Burnwal The trend of Indian students pursuing studies abroad has experienced a remarkable resurgence post-decline of the Covid pandemic. This is evident in the recent statistics released by the Ministry of Education. The data reveals a significant upswing in the number of Indian students undertaking higher education overseas, soaring to 750,365 as compared to 444,553 students in 2021. Despite an increasing number of students heading abroad for higher studies, the tuition fees and cost of living are still pretty high for Indian students. It often serves as the decisive factor for students in their academic pursuits overseas. While the steep tuition fees pose a concern, the cost of accommodation can be particularly staggering for students seeking affordable alternatives. For instance, the average tuition fee for undergraduate programmes in the USA and Canada is approximately Rs 40 lakh and Rs 19 lakh, respectively. However, the cost of accommodation for a four-year programme in these countries hover around Rs 48 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, respectively. Given the overall high cost of expenditures associated with pursuing studies overseas, it is prudent for students to explore scholarship opportunities proactively while conceptualising their dreams. Given below are some of the distinguished scholarship programmes that Indian students must consider in their quest for international education: Fulbright-Nehru Master's Fellowships Programme Administered by the United States-India Educational Foundation (USIEF), this programme provides funding to Indian students who are pursuing their Master's degree programme in the United States.

175562249,Covid Sub-Variant JN.1: INSACOG Says 196 Cases Detected In India,"NEW DELHI, Jan 1: A total of 196 cases of COVID-19 sub-variant JN.1 have been detected in the country so far, with Odisha joining the list of states that have detected the presence of the variant, according to the INSACOG’s (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium) data updated on January 1. Ten states and Union territories have so far detected the presence of the JN.1 sub-variant of the virus. These states are Kerala (83), Goa (51), Gujarat (34), Karnataka (eight), Maharashtra (seven), Rajasthan (five), Tamil Nadu (four), Telangana (two) Odisha (one) and Delhi (one), according to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG). The INSACOG’s data showed 179 Covid cases recorded in the country in December had the presence of JN.1, while 17 such cases were detected in November. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has classified JN.1 as a separate “variant of interest” given its rapidly-increasing spread, but said it poses a “low” global public health risk. The JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus was previously classified as a variant of interest (VOI) as part of the BA.2.86 sub-lineages, the parent lineage that is classified as a VOI, the world body said. However, in recent weeks, JN.1 cases continued to be reported from multiple countries and its prevalence has rapidly increased globally. The Centre has asked the states and Union territories to maintain a constant vigil amid an uptick in the number of Covid cases and the detection of the JN.1 sub-variant in the country. India has recorded 636 new coronavirus infections, while the active cases stood at 4,394, according to the data released by the Health Ministry on January 1.

175563367,"Transfer window opens: the latest football news, rumours and done deals – live","The Observer asked fans of all 20 Premier League clubs for their January wish-lists. Let’s take a look, starting (predictably enough) with Arsenal and Aston Villa. Arsenal FFP is a factor here. If we can’t count on the fitness of Thomas Partey, perhaps the Saudis can tempt him. I’m hoping we’re not forced to flog the homegrown likes of Emile Smith Rowe, but frankly, with everyone chasing a proven goalscorer, selling Fábio Vieira etc won’t make much of a dent in the fee demanded for Ivan Toney or Dominic Solanke. Elsewhere, Douglas Luiz won’t be the only Villa player coveted by plenty of clubs, but I just can’t see how we stump up £100m for him. Based on his impressive pre-season form, I’d settle for Jurriën Timber’s early recovery from the ACL injury he suffered in the opening game; he’ll feel like a new signing and might well energise our squad in the finishing straight. Bernard Azulay onlinegooner.com Aston Villa Do we stick or twist? Does swinging the bat now risk overpaying and disrupting a harmonious dressing room, or is it irresponsible not to have a proper go when this might be our best chance of the Champions League – or even the title – for years? We have good cover in most positions apart from the hardest two to fill: reserve keeper and back-up centre-forward. Solanke is a great age, it would mean we could slightly adapt styles and he seems like a nice boy. But he’s not cheap and would he come to initially play second fiddle? Personally I’d play 13th fiddle for anyone if they doubled my wages, but anyway. Unai Emery will have lined up two or three fine Europeans I’ve never heard of, and of course the really good teams strengthen in areas where they’re already strong, so I won’t be overanalysing his logic, such is my unconditional faith in the man. I’ll be happy whatever he does.

175560893,Couple treat pet pigs to bubble baths and organic smoothies - and let them sleep in their bed,"Meet the pampered pigs who are treated to bubble baths, organic smoothies and even sleep in their owner's bed. Mini pigs Penelope Rose, five, and Daisy Dukes, two months, are ""spoilt"" by their loving owners, Jacey and Marcus Tinsley. The couple, both 32, let their pet porkers run riot around their house - and say their lives ""revolve around the pigs"". Penelope - who tips the scales at 80lbs - loves a spa day and will get her hair cut and brushed, nails painted and dolled up in a tutu. Little Daisy weighs just 5lbs but will grow to a similar size as her 'big sister' and loves to snuggle up to the couple in bed and charge around the house. Jacey and Marcus, a singer, say the two pigs are ""best friends"" and they couldn't imagine their lives without them. Jacey, a content creator, from Phoenix, Arizona, US, said: ""They run the show here. ""They sleep in bed with us. Daisy wakes me up in the middle of the night nibbling my ear. ""The get on the couch and watch movies. ""They are our world. Our lives revolve around them."" Pig lover Jacey asked Marcus if they could get a pet hog and after he agreed the pair spent time researching if it was possible. Jacey said: ""I have always loved pigs. ""I never thought it was possible to get pet pigs."" They brought Penelope home at eight weeks old in 2018 - after splashing out £950 on her. In November 2023 they brought home Daisy to join their family - spending £500 on her. Jacey said: ""We wanted to make sure we could handle them all. ""They are best friends. They are adorable."" The couple say the pigs have different personalities. Marcus said: ""Penelope is the most chill, relaxed lazy pig. ""Daisy is a little firecracker."" Every morning the pigs are fed organic veggies and pig pellets - and the couple say they don't spend more than £100 on food for them per month. Marcus said: ""Sometimes I share Cheerios and we eat together. ""They have our smoothies sometimes too. ""Essentially they are like having a toddler."" The pigs have a weekly bubble bath and Penelope also gets a spa day - which she loves. She also loves to get dressed up - donning tutus and hats. Marcus said: ""Penelope is a diva. She gets her haircut, nails painted. ""She loves the glitz and glam."" Jacey added: ""She gets her hair brushed and lotion on her."" Daisy isn't so keen on spa days but adores the couple's daughter, Taylee, 12. Jacey said: ""Taylee is crazy about them."" The couple didn't leave Penelope for five years and only did so for the first time last year. Instead, they took her everywhere they went - on holiday, walks and to the shops. Marcus said: ""When we first got Penelope we took her on holidays. ""We snuck her into hotels. ""We took them to the malls."" Now the couple have a ""pig palace"" in their bedroom for the pets to go in when they nip out for an errand - full of blankets. They also have a pig sitter if they go away for a longer period of time. The couple hope to expand their pig family and hope to one day open a pig rescue. Jacey said: ""It's a full happy house. ""I can't remember a time before pigs. ""We wouldn't trade it for the world. ""We're crazy about them."" Marcus added: ""I never thought I'd be in love with pigs, but here we are.""

The week-long competition which started on Friday, 22nd to 30th December 2023 has Alramma Ibrahim Muhammad from Bauchi and Malama Zainab Aliyu from Kano emerging as the best performing for male and female category respectively. Tinubu, represented by the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress Party (APC) Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje made the commendation during the closing ceremony of the competition at the August 27th Stadium Damaturu. The president stated that the hosting of the competition by the people and government of Yobe State has clearly demonstrated the willingness of the people especially the traditional rulers and the youths in strengthening the recitation of the glorious qur’an in the country. “The President of the federal republic of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has requested me to appreciate and congratulate the governor of Yobe State for providing an enabling environment especially at this trying period of our security challenges. “He also requested me to appreciate and congratulate the Sultan of Sokoto and all the traditional rulers who are always assisting this programme, who are always trying to make this competition stronger and stronger.” Also, the president general of the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) and Sultan of Sokoto Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III expressed happiness that the competition witnessed the emergence of winners of different categories from across the country, especially the south.

175563737,The combat sports power rankings 2024: Boxing and MMA’s 50 most influential figures,"The landscapes in boxing and mixed martial arts are perhaps the most treacherous in all of sports, with fighters not always possessing the power, which is instead often held in the hands of managers, promoters and broadcasters. Below, The Independent has taken a look at where the control lies, also factoring in the fighters who have been able to use their talent and popularity to carve out their own influence. The result? Rankings of the 50 most influential figures in combat sports. The list is of course subjective, with many fair arguments to be made about the placement of each name, and we’ve gone beyond boxing and MMA in certain cases. On that note, let’s kick off the rankings with... Jiu-jitsu’s popularity worldwide is growing rapidly, with the grappling-centric martial art featuring heavily in MMA contests and now having a young star in its own right: Gordon Ryan. The American is just 28 – do not let his dyed grey hair and beard deceive you – and is already regarded as the greatest no-Gi competitor in the history of the sport. A multiple-time world champion, Ryan has controversially advocated performance-enhancing drugs in combat sports, but many jiu-jitsu practitioners look up to the American anyway. With time, Joe Rogan has spent less time at the UFC commentary desk, and Anik has emerged as the true, modern voice of the promotion. A consummate professional, the 45-year-old American essentially leads UFC broadcasts in between calling the fights, and he has provided numerous calls that have defined some of the greatest moments in MMA history. The other voice of the UFC. Buffer, the brother of a famous Michael, has emulated the boxing ring announcer’s success but in MMA. While Michael has his own legendary catchphrase (more on that later), Bruce has become beloved for his emphatic, “It’s time!”, his contageous energy, and his flashy suits. He is a key part of what makes a UFC title fight feel monumental. Benn, son of British boxing great Nigel, was forging a solid pro career in his own right until his fight with Chris Eubank Jr – a strange sort of third part to the Nigel vs Chris Sr rivalry – fell apart in 2022. That bout collapsed after it was revealed that Benn, 27, had failed two drug tests, and he is still unable to box in Britain as a result. However, the saga – in which he has maintained his innocence – has bolstered Benn’s profile and made more fans care about him, even if many are rooting for him to fail. The fight with Eubank Jr, should it ever materialise, would be huge. His back-to-back bouts with Conor McGregor in 2016 made Diaz a crossover star, when he was already a UFC fan favourite. The American, now 38, remains a pay-per-view draw, and he recently crossed over in a different way, boxing Jake Paul in August. Diaz came up short that night but secured another major payday, and fans eagerly anticipate his next move – with many hoping that it will be a long-awaited trilogy fight against McGregor. Diaz is no longer signed to the UFC, however, meaning a new deal would need to be hashed out. The American boxing coach works with welterweight star Errol Spence Jr and rising lightweight Ryan Garcia, and he even trained Anthony Joshua for the Briton’s bouts with Jermaine Franklin and Robert Helenius in 2023. Spence Jr and Garcia suffered defeats in high-profile fights last year – to Terence Crawford and Gervonta Davos respectively – but remains one of the most in-demand coaches around. Davis is the chairman of the Professional Fighters League, which has emerged as the main rival to the UFC in recent years. The 61-year-old American has overseen the PFL’s purchase of Bellator – the UFC’s former chief competitor – and deals with Jake Paul and Francis Ngannou. Having those names on the PFL’s roster should make for an intriguing 2024. Britain’s second UFC champion ever, Edwards is a great ambassador for MMA in his home nation and for the sport in general. The welterweight title holder has a remarkable life story, having escaped deadly conditions in Jamaica – his country of birth – with his mother and younger brother, before beginning the journey that would lead him to UFC gold. To win the welterweight title in 2022, Edwards produced one of the greatest knockouts in UFC history. Although he is a talented young lightweight, Garcia does not seem to be on the level of some of his fellow American stars in the division. However, he is a skilled commodity – seemingly a geuine pay-per-view draw – and could follow his 2023 loss to Gervonta Davis with fights against Devin Haney and Teofimo Lopez. An all-time great in the boxing ring, the 45-year-old is the sport’s only eight-division world champion. His clash with Floyd Mayweather in 2015 – several years too late, admittedly – remains the highest-grossing pay-per-view in boxing history. That record looks likely to stand for many years to come. The Filipino also served as a senator in his home country from 2016 until 2022, but he fought professionally as recently as 2021. Some see Terence Crawford as boxing’s pound-for-pound No 1, but Indy Sport is among those to award that honour to Inoue, the four-weight world champion from Japan. The fittingly-nicknamed “Monster” recently became undisputed in a second division, as the only man other than Crawford to achieve that feat, and his stoppage rate is even more impressive than the American’s. Speed, power, imagination – the 30-year-old has it all. A breakout MMA star in 2021, with his profile only growing in the two years since, the Brazilian has enjoyed such success relatively later in his career. Oliveira, now 34, was 31 when he won the UFC lightweight title and was already 39 fights into his pro career. “Do Bronx” has since lost the belt but is still on an impressive run overall, and he could yet regain the gold in 2024... The American is one of the hardest-hitting punchers in boxing history, with that asset aiding him in his long reign as WBC heavyweight champion. Wilder, 38, was finally beaten in 2020, when Tyson Fury stopped the “Bronze Bomber” – before repeating the trick in 2021 – and now appears to be past his peak. Wilder was comprehensively outboxed and outpointed in December, as Joseph Parker dealt the American a damaging blow and potentially cost him a long-awaited clash with Anthony Joshua. One of heavyweight boxing’s true icons, Tyson has found new relevancy in recent years with his Hotboxin’ podcast. It has allowed the American, 57, to show off a different, more relaxed side to himself. It is a side that people seem to love. There are a couple of names later on this list who vie for the title of ‘the greatest ever’ in women’s boxing, but the best right now? Surely Shields, although her ‘GWOAT’ nickname tells you all you need to know about how highly the American rates herself. Shields, still just 28, has already become undisputed in two weight classes and unified champion in another. So, she has earnt the right to rate herself so highly. One of the greatest featherweights in MMA history, and the consensus pound-for-pound No 1 until recently. The Australian has been dominant at 145lbs, where he is UFC champion, and his only defeats over the last decade both came in 2023 – with the 35-year-old losing a narrow decision to lightweight champion Islam Makhachev in February, before suffering a knockout against the Russian in October. Even in the latter instance, though, “Alexander The Great” rightly received credit for stepping up on short notice. The most famous MMA journalist on the planet, Helwani is more easily recognisable than many fighters, in fact. The Canadian was an insider long before his stint at ESPN, and he has continued to thrive even since leaving the network. Indeed, Helwani has thrived in spite of being banned from live events by the UFC, with many fighters desperate to appear on his YouTube show, The MMA Hour, as a result of the immense exposure that it guarantees. Helwani has also dipped his toe into NBA and boxing coverage. The US promoter, 63, counts world champion Amanda Serrano among his fighters, as well as ex-champions George Kambosos Jr and Regis Prograis. DiBella may not be as well known as some of the promoters that you’ll find later on this list, but his influence is still significant. One of MMA’s few, genuine crossover stars since McGregor hit and passed his peak. Many fans doubted whether “Sugar Sean” could match his popularity with in-ring success, feeling that the sniper striker might be let down by holes elsewhere in his game. Those doubts were undermined, however, when O’Malley knocked out wrestling specialist Aljamain Sterling in round two in August, becoming the UFC men’s bantamweight champion in the process. The voice of boxing. For decades, the 79-year-old has stood out as the sport’s most famous ring announcer, in large part due to his catchphrase, “Leeeeeeeeet’s get ready to ruuuuuuumble!” which he wisely trademarked in 1992 – a move that has reportedly earned the American $400m... Like his brother Jake (yes, we’ll get to him), the American started off as a YouTuber before venturing into combat sports. The older Paul brother, 28, began boxing in 2018 and later signed with WWE, where he has prospered since 2022. Outside of various rings, Paul has also seen success with his energy drink Prime and with his Impaulsive podcast. The UFC’s Vice-President of Talent Relations, Maynard is a chief matchmaker in the organisation. For all the UFC’s faults, its ability to produce fan-favourite match-ups is unrivalled, and it deserves credit for that – meaning Maynard does, too. MMA’s greatest fighter ever, in the eyes of many fans. Others hold the American’s multiple failed drug tests against his legacy, as well as incidents like a hit-and-run in 2015. Jones, 36, took a three-year break from MMA between 2020 and 2023, returning in March to easily win the UFC heavyweight title after spending the rest of his career as a light-heavyweight – and as a multiple-time champion in that division, no less. “Tank” is one of the most fearsome punchers in boxing, but that asset has ironically seen some top-level fights elude the American. He finally got his first big-name opponent in April, when he stopped Ryan Garcia emphatically, but now he must press on in securing bouts with the likes of Devin Haney and Teofimo Lopez. A long-reigning middleweight champion in the UFC, and one of the first superstars to emerge in MMA after McGregor’s peak. The Nigerian-born New Zealander, 34, recently saw his second UFC title reign come to an end and is taking a brief break from the sport. Whenever he returns, however, his next bout will likely be one of the most watched of 2024 or 2025, courtesy of the interest he has generated through his enthralling striking. The manager of Ukrainian icons Oleksandr Usyk and Vasiliy Lomachenko, Klimas has been a key player in this generation of boxing, recently and notably playing his part in arranging Usyk’s upcoming clash with Tyson Fury – which is set to be the biggest fight in decades. A pioneer of women’s boxing. In the biggest women’s fight of all time – and one of boxing’s biggest ever, full stop – the Puerto Rican was unlucky to lose a decision against Katie Taylor in 2022. The 35-year-old should be remembered for much more than that bout, however, when all is said and done; the unified featherweight champion is the only woman to have held world titles in more than four divisions. Nowhere near the boxer that his half-brother Tyson is, but Tommy has played a smart game. The 24-year-old Briton endeared himself to viewers of the reality television show Love Island before returning to boxing, where he has wisely chosen to fight YouTubers instead of legitimate pros. That is not meant as a slight; Fury is better matched in that sphere and is making much more money than he otherwise would. The UFC’s chief business officer and, according to many, the real mastermind at the UFC – not Dana White. The former lawyer has been tipped to succeed White as UFC president, but that role would require much more interaction with the media and public than Campbell currently engages in. Perhaps the next face of boxing. At just 25 years old, Haney has also reigned as undisputed lightweight champion and moved up to collect another world title at super-lightweight. The American has insisted, however, that he has little interest in becoming undisputed again; the “Dream” is keen on super-fights, likely suggesting that he would be content to make as much money as possible before retiring young. DuBoef is the stepson of Bob Arum (more on him later) and the president of the 91-year-old’s promotion, Top Rank Boxing. As such, DuBoef is Arum’s likeliest successor, meaning his power in the boxing sphere should only grow in years to come. The 62-year-old is the founder and CEO of Endeavor, the parent company of the UFC and now also WWE, following a seismic business deal in 2023. It will be intriguing to see how that deal impacts the landscape of MMA and pro wrestling moving forward. In any case, Emanuel will be looking over that very landscape, and he is also said to have significant influence in Hollywood. The best ever in the boxing ring? According to many, yes. Having retired unbeaten as a pro in 2017, the 46-year-old American has since been on a prolonged victory lap, beating boxers, MMA fighters and YouTubers in various exhibition bouts. One of the standout names from this generation of mixed martial artists, the Cameroonian has repeatedly gambled on himself and won big. After leaving the UFC in January 2023, giving up the company’s heavyweight title in the process, the 37-year-old was criticised for ‘fumbling the bag’. Far from it. Ngannou signed a contract with the PFL, where he will make significantly more money than he did in the UFC. The “Predator” also made his boxing debut in October, dropping and arguably doing enough to beat Tyson Fury – only to come up short on points – in one of the most stupefying moments in combat-sports history. If not the greatest women’s boxer of all time, the most important. The Irishwoman initiated the movement that allowed female fighters to compete at the Olympics, where she won gold in 2012. She has since became a two-weight undisputed champion, collecting the second set of belts recently. The 37-year-old beat Chantelle Cameron in a modern classic in November, avenging the only loss of her pro career in the same Dublin venue where she was beaten in May. The greatest cruiserweight of this generation, Usyk is the only man to have been undisputed champion in that division in the four-belt era. Now, he is on the verge of one of boxing’s most remarkable feats ever, as he prepares to face Tyson Fury and potentially become undisputed at heavyweight. The southpaw, 36, is as tricky as they come, as he demonstrated in back-to-back points wins over Anthony Joshua. Yes, to see his name (and a few of the above entries) before the next man’s may be jolting. Arguably boxing’s pound-for-pound No 1, the unbeaten American stopped Errol Spence Jr in an all-time great performance last summer to become undisputed welterweight champion. The 36-year-old has since been stripped of one of his titles, but he won’t mind, having settled one of modern boxing’s biggest debates by beating the previously undefeated Spence Jr in a fight years in the making. His win over Spence Jr also made him the first male boxer to become undisputed in two divisions in the four-belt era. Like Jake Paul, KSI has made a transition from YouTube into boxing, and while he lacks the dedication and relative skill of his American counterpart, the Briton still attracts a huge viewership and has a wildly dedicated legion of fans. His bout with Tommy Fury, like Paul’s, was one of the most-watched fights of 2023. Unfortunately for the 30-year-old, it went the same way as Paul’s, too. The jiu-jitsu black belt and former TV presenter is not as involved on UFC commentary as he used to be, but his Joe Rogan Experience podcast is one of the most successful in all of sport – in all of podcasting, in fact. And since signing a major deal with Spotify, the 56-year-old has even more money than influence – which is a lot, especially with males between the ages of 18 and 34 in America. Ninety-one years old but still involved at the top end of boxing. Arum’s Top Rank is one of the sport’s biggest players, especially due to its broadcast deal with ESPN. In recent years, Arum’s greatest success might have been securing Tyson Fury’s signature to make Top Rank the Briton’s US promoter. The American promoter seemingly suffered a blow when US broadcaster Showtime pulled out of boxing recently, but Haymon’s Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) has since signed with Amazon Prime. The 68-year-old previously managed Floyd Mayweather, and PBC counts Terence Crawford, Deontay Wilder, Errol Spence Jr and Manny Pacquaio among its fighters. “If you asked someone on the street to name three people in UK boxing, they’d probably go: ‘Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua, Eddie Hearn.’” Those were the words of... well, Hearn, in our exclusive interview in 2023 – and the rest of this list is somewhat in keeping with that sentiment. Hearn is omnipresent in boxing, popping up on YouTube multiple times a week for interview after interview. As he has said more than once, he knows “how to sell”. Just as Hearn prizes Anthony Joshua, the promoter’s chief rival Warren counts Tyson Fury as his greatest asset. Warren, 71, has been around numerous blocks numerous times, and his recent progress with key players in Saudi Arabia marks a huge success in a vital moment in boxing history. That progress also sees him edge ahead of Hearn here. Eyebrows might raise over this entry, but Paul’s is another name that has massive crossover capabilities. Again, many will watch simply in hopes that the American, 26, will lose, but the YouTuber’s boxing career survived his first defeat – against Tommy Fury in February – and he is planning to venture into MMA next. He has also been an advocate for greater fighter pay, to his credit, and holds boxing wins over MMA stars like Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley. Even two-and-a-half years on from his last fight – and four years on from his last win – the former UFC champion commands attention like few others. When the Irishman competes, the fighting world stops, and even the average person on the street tends to be aware. Adulation for McGregor, 35, has worn off in his home country in recent years after his series of run-ins with the law, but he has never needed love to thrive; perhaps the hate is just as effective. There was a concerted effort to make Joshua the heavyweight of this generation, before Fury naturally eclipsed his compatriot for various reasons, including Joshua’s trio of losses over the last four years. Even so, much of the British public still harbours great respect for the 34-year-old, who won Olympic gold in London and went on to provide fans with many fun nights courtesy of his knockouts during his come-up. “AJ” is one of the biggest ‘brands’ in sports, and he isn’t done yet in the ring. For a while, arguments raged over whether the unbeaten Briton might be the greatest heavyweight ever. While that status seems to have eluded him, given his lack of big-name opponents in comparison to champions gone by, the consensus is that the 35-year-old is the best heavyweight of his generation. Before becoming WBC champion, Fury held the other belts at once, and he will bid to regain them and become undisputed champion – the first in 24 years – when he faces Oleksandr Usyk in February. The “Gypsy King” demonstrated his influence by delaying that fight until he could have it almost entirely on his terms. While the Mexican is no longer boxing’s pound-for-pound No 1, he is still an elite fighter, a rare pay-per-view draw, an idol in his home country, and the face of boxing worldwide – and he is still just 33 years old. He has flitted between weight classes while taking on all comers, and he continues to reign as undisputed super-middleweight champion. Mixed martial arts is one of the fastest-growing sports in the world, and the UFC is MMA’s undisputed leader. UFC president Dana White may not in fact be the undisputed leader of the promotion (as previous entries on this list have hinted), but he is its figurehead and is more famous than many UFC fighters. The outspoken American, 54, has a remarkable sway over fans’ opinions and a firm control over fighters’ careers. If you don’t recognise Al-Sheikh’s name (sometimes written Alalshikh) at once, the words “His Excellency” may ring a bell, as that is how all of boxing’s kingmakers refer to the Saudi adviser, who might have usurped those very kingmakers at lightning speed in a matter of months. Al-Sheikh, who is also Chairman of General Authority for Entertainment in the Gulf state, is the figure behind the miraculous matchmaking in boxing recently – including Tyson Fury vs Francis Ngannou and the Day of Reckoning event featuring Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder. Right now, even the biggest promoters in the sport seem to be bowing to the 42-year-old’s demands; Saudi Arabia’s immense funds are enabling all of this impressive matchmaking, but Al-Sheikh is the mind that is directing the money.",https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing-ufc-rankings-fighters-promoters-b2470814.html,https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/12/29/15/newFile-3.jpg?width=1200,2024-01-01 12:49:28,Alex Pattle,['Alex Pattle'],en,gb,0.318
175567431,"BJP enters 2024 with a skip in its step, eye on South, building on its positives","No other party or combination in the recent history of India has stepped into an election year with such confidence like the BJP does in 2024. Exuberant with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's still intact popularity and upbeat with the recent electoral victories, the party is sure of its win in 2024. “Only the number matters,” party leaders insist, especially if the BJP can better last year's result. However, like party president J P Nadda says, the BJP does not take any election lightly. At the public meeting after inaugurating the new Maharishi Valmiki Airport in Ayodhya last week, the PM described this as “the joint strength of vikas (development) and virasat (heritage)”. In the words of the BJP, “impatient to see India grow”, in his next term, Modi would focus on making up for lost time. “His second term was marked by the Covid pandemic, China aggression and Russia-Ukraine war, all three factors that slowed down the targeted economic growth,” says a Union Minister, adding that the government hopes to now cash in on the prevalent anti-China sentiment globally. Modi's invocation of “virasat (heritage)” is a continuation of this, BJP leaders say, as “India's cultural history, democratic history, and values and the culture of inclusion” cast it in a favourable light as compared to China, and more in tune with Western sentiments. Apart from China, the next term is likely to see India take a more aggressive stand against Pakistan, with the revocation of Article 370 now getting the formal seal of approval of the Supreme Court and with the neighbouring country caught up in its own inner turmoil. With most of the boxes of its key ideological project ticked, Modi is expected to move fast on the remaining ones, including a uniform civil code and the row over the birthplace of Lord Krishna in Mathura. BJP leaders admit that the party's biggest challenge would be job creation, if it wants to take advantage of the country's young demography – even compared to China, India's average age is 10 years younger. The skilling initiative to ready people for all levels of jobs has not been very successful. Then there is the BJP's thwarted ambition to conquer the South. While this year's Assembly poll loss in Karnataka was another blow, the BJP has already started making amends in the state that gave it 25 of its 28 seats in 2019. One of the big moves was to tie up with the JD(S), to consolidate the Vokkaliga vote, while accepting veteran B S Yeddyurapa's preeminence in the Karnataka unit to secure Lingayat support. And, if the Telangana polls were a disappointment, BJP sources say, the party is getting positive feedback from Tamil Nadu and emerging as the most preferred alternative to the ruling DMK. Party leaders claim the 2024 Lok Sabha results in Tamil Nadu would be a surprise, given Modi's “rising acceptance” in a state whose politics has long drawn sustenance from anti-North India sentiments. While they are officially no longer allies, the BJP has channels open with the AIADMK, and this could further bolster the BJP kitty. In Andhra Pradesh too, the BJP is fishing for allies to get the Lok Sabha numbers. Organisationally, the BJP has already made it clear that large-scale changes are on the cards. In all the three states it won recently, the party went in for surprise names as chief minister candidates – dislodging satraps - and proceeded to fill the caste gaps with the composition of the ministries. “In order to make the party stronger, Modiji will be bringing in more youngsters and fresh faces to the front,” a leader says. Sources said one measure the current leadership may take to keep the door revolving is limiting the terms of a party CM or chief to two terms. Even the Union ministers who have completed two terms could be offered different roles post 2024 Lok Sabha elections. “All the seniors will have to work hard as both the government and the party will be more demanding,” says a leader.",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bjp-2024-lok-sabha-elections-9090611/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/road-to-2024-bjp.jpg,2024-01-01 12:49:47,"Liz Mathew, PM Modi","['Liz Mathew', 'PM Modi']",en,in,-0.055
175569667,"Trashigang District Election Dispute Settlement Body fines Kanglung_Samkhar_Udzorong’s PDP candidate, PDP supporter, and a business owner","The Trashigang District Election Dispute Settlement Body fined the People’s Democratic Party’s Kanglung_Samkhar_Udzorong’s candidate, a party supporter, and a business owner for violating the provisions of the Election Act and other regulations, yesterday. The PDP’s Kanglung_Samkhar_Udzorong’s candidate, Norbu Wangchuk, complained to the District Election Dispute Settlement Body that the Bhutan Tendrel Party President, Pema Chewang, who is also the party’s Kanglung_Samkhar_Udzorong candidate donated Nu 10,000 for a marathon competition during the 116th National Day Celebrations. According to the District Election Dispute Settlement Body’s decision, Norbu Wangchuk alleged that the donation was in contravention of the Election Act and other regulations. The decision also states that BTP’s Pema Chewang refuted the allegation saying he did not give the donation despite getting a request for one during a meeting with Kanglung business people. Furthermore, the decision stated that Pema Chewang deemed the complaint was put up to defame him and the party, and requested the body to fine Norbu Wangchuk for the same. According to the decision, the PDP candidate could not produce evidence and witness to back up the claim of donation and that without verifying claims made by a few individuals he had alleged others, which is in violation of section 294 of the Election Act and the Rules on Election Conduct 2022. PDP’s Norbu Wangchuk was fined Nu 37,500. Similarly, a supporter of the People’s Democratic Party, Kinzang Tobgay, was fined Nu 15,000 for spreading word about the donation without verifying the claims. The business owner, Rinchen Peldon, who sought donation from the BTP president was also fined Nu 15,000. The District Election Dispute Settlement Body’s decision states that such act is not allowed during the election period. She had also organised the marathon without permission from the Election Commission of Bhutan.

175566999,Morocco law reform offers hope for women’s rights,"Two decades after a landmark but limited revision of Morocco’s family law marked a breakthrough for women, activists hope new reforms will defy Islamist objections and provide greater equality. The reform of the legal code was ordered directly by King Mohammed VI, who is expected to have the final say in any disputes over the new law. A committee tasked with drafting the changes was formed in September and includes the justice minister as well as judicial and religious figures. By the end of November, the committee had already received proposals from more than 1,000 civil organisations, as well as political parties and official institutions. ‘Devil has returned’: Divorced Afghan women forced back to abusive ex-husbands Women’s rights advocates in the North African country have given a hopeful welcome to the plans. Latifa Bouchoua, a member of the Federation of Women’s Rights Leagues (FLDF), said she wanted “a deeper reform (than the last) adapted to the aspirations of new generations who believe in rights and freedoms”. Activists are demanding equality in inheritance, child custody, and a total ban on child marriage – none of which they say are guaranteed under the current family code. The most recent reform took place in 2004 and was heralded as a breakthrough at the time. However, campaigners say the changes still failed to provide women with their full rights. That code gave women joint responsibility for their families, which had previously been granted only to men, and imposed restrictions on unilateral divorce by men, polygamy and underage marriage. However, the reforms fell short of preventing “injustice, discrimination, and legal violence, whether in the text or in its application”, said Samira Muheya, president of the FLDF. In the summer of 2022, King Mohammed said in a speech Morocco needed to “address the deficiencies and negative aspects noted from experience” of the family code. Under current legislation, women are entitled only to half of what men inherit, in line with strict interpretations of the Koran. Polygamy remains legal, although it requires men to have the written consent of their first wife. Only 0.3 per cent of marriages across Morocco in 2022 were polygamous, according to officials. In a divorce, men receive custody of their children by default, while those mothers who do gain custody of their children lose it immediately if they remarry. The key demand made by activists is an end to child marriage. While the legal age for marriage was raised from 15 to 18 in 2004, the authorities continue to issue exemptions for underage girls to marry. A study by the public prosecutor’s office found that 85 per cent of all requests to marry an underage girl submitted between 2011 and 2018 were approved. At COP28, activists urge leaders to address impact of climate change on women Atifa Timjerdine, vice-president of the Democratic Association of Moroccan Women, said the issue “embodies … the discrimination of the law and raises great concerns”. Supporters of women’s rights said gender inequality in Morocco covered much more than family issues alone. Writer Ahmed Assid said the forthcoming reform should go beyond household rules and aim to “change the patriarchal system” as a whole, which he said was “responsible, for example, for widespread unemployment among women, even as girls represent around two thirds of baccalaureate winners each year”. Nearly 35 per cent of women with a university degree are unemployed in Morocco, compared with 20.8 per cent among men, according to official figures. Nevertheless, there has been vocal opposition to the idea of liberal reforms, especially from religious groups. The calls for equality and banning underage marriage and polygamy drew strong objections from within the country’s Islamist organisations, which maintain that such practices are drawn from a traditionalist interpretation of Islamic texts. Al Adl Wa Al Ihsane, an Islamist group that is officially banned but to which the authorities turn a blind eye, insists on “the supremacy of the Islamic reference system” and rejects “any proposal that contradicts it”. The Islamist Justice and Development Party said it would only accept amendments to the law that fitted within “the Islamic framework”. The FLDF’s Muheya insisted that campaigners’ demands were compatible with an “enlightened” interpretation of Islamic texts, and pointed to the principle of equality enshrined in Morocco’s 2011 constitution.",https://www.scmp.com/news/world/africa/article/3246906/morocco-law-reform-offers-hope-womens-rights,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/01/142484fc-1b6a-45f0-b740-eb2de6c50e95_1a67859d.jpg,2024-01-01 12:57:21,"Agence France-Presse, King Mohammed VI","['Agence France-Presse', 'King Mohammed VI']",en,cn,0.201
175565861,PSLV-C58 XPoSat: India launches satellite to study black holes from Sriharikota,"The Indian Space Research Organisation successfully launched India’s first X-Ray Polarimeter Satellite on Monday, or XPoSat, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The satellite is designed to provide information about celestial objects such as black holes. It was carried into space by a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket. According to the ISRO, the PSLV-C58 rocket successfully launched payload XPoSat into Low Earth Orbit on its 60th flight. On January 1, the PSLV-C58 rocket took off at 9.10 a.m. from this spaceport’s first launch pad, which is situated around 135 kilometres east of Chennai. It is the first specifically designed ISRO scientific satellite to conduct studies on polarisation measurements of X-ray radiation from astronomical sources from space. Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) studied supernova explosion remnants, black hole particle streams, and other cosmic occurrences in December 2021 with the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer mission. Although India has established space-based X-ray astronomy with an emphasis on imaging and time domain investigations, the space agency stated that Monday’s mission represents a significant contribution to the scientific community. In order to conduct long-term spectral and temporal investigations of cosmic X-ray sources, the PSLV-C58 mission aims to measure the polarisation of X-rays in the energy band 8-30 keV emitted by about 50 possible cosmic sources. When analysing the radiation process and geometry of astronomical sources, X-ray polarisation is an essential diagnostic tool. POLIX (Polarimeter Instrument in X-Rays), developed by the Raman Research Institute to determine polarimetry parameters, and XSPECT (X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing), constructed by the U R Rao Satellite Centre, Bengaluru, are the main payloads of XPoSat. With the launch of its first X-Ray Polarimeter satellite, the ISRO ushered in the new year. Following the success of the Gaganyaan Test Vehicle D1 mission in October, the launch occurred. India achieved unprecedented achievement in 2023 with the gentle landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the Moon’s south pole and the launch of Aditya-L1, the country’s first solar mission. Following the momentous August 23 landing of Vikram Lander on the Moon, the Pragyan rover was sent out to explore the lunar south pole, which had not before been explored. India’s current objectives include the Gaganyaan Mission, establishing Bharatiya Antariksha Station by 2035, and sending the country’s first person to the moon by 2040.",https://apnlive.com/india-news/mumbai-drunk-driving/,https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/apnlive/uploads/2024/01/01172454/images-97-1000x600.webp,2024-01-01 12:57:22,APN Live,['APN Live'],en,in,-0.166
175564795,1 Lakh People Participate In Bhaderwah Winter Festival In J&#038;K&#8217;s Doda,"Jammu, Jan 1: More than one lakh people visited the five-day Bhaderwah winter festival in Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district that concluded on Sunday with a celebration to usher in the new year. The festival is a symbol of the cultural splendour and winter charm of the Chenab Valley and aims at promoting the local culture and traditions, and showcase the tourism potential of Bhaderwah, officials said. The tourism department is “committed to tap the untapped tourism potential of Bhaderwah and other lesser known tourist destinations” of Jammu and Kashmir, Tourism Secretary Abid Rashid said. “The aim of holding such kinds of festivals is to promote local culture, traditions, and to tap the tourism potential” of areas bestowed with natural scenic and serene surroundings, he said. Rashid said the department is also promoting homestays to meet the shortage of tourism infrastructure and to create livelihood for locals. The festival was organised by the Directorate of Tourism, Jammu, in collaboration with the Doda district administration, the Academy of Art, Culture and Language and the Bhaderwah Development Authority. To conclude the festival, there was a performance by Punjabi singer Kaka and a display of fireworks. Over the five days, the Bhaderwah Fort was illuminated and it hosted several cultural performances. Films such as ‘Sam Bahadur’, ‘Tiger-3′ and ’12th Fail’ were screened during the festival. “The festival not only showcased the natural beauty and cultural heritage of Bhaderwah but also marked its emergence as a dynamic hub of tourism in the Chenab Valley, blending tradition with modernity,” Doda Deputy Commissioner S Harvinder Singh said. He expressed keen interest in encouraging the tourism sector in the district to create livelihood opportunities and to give the district its due share on the tourism map of the country. “All measures will be taken to improve the tourism infrastructure of the district,” Singh said. The deputy commissioner said that in view of the great potential of the district in the tourism sector, some private stakeholders have already pitched in, and world-class hotels and some five-star facilities are being established. The administration is committed to work towards having tourism activities in the district throughout the year, he said. Joint Director Tourism Sunaina Mehta said Bhaderwah has been earmarked as a wedding destination and a site for ‘Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE)’ tourism. She said last year, over five lakh tourists visited Bhaderwah.

175564763,"24 things we think will happen in 2024: politics, movies, sports, and tech","It was either the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr or Hall of Fame New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra (or, quite possibly, neither of them) who coined the phrase: “Predictions are hard to make, especially about the future.” Nonetheless, for the fifth year in a row, the staff of Future Perfect will venture its best estimations of what major news events will or won’t take place in 2024. Will Donald Trump return to the White House? Will OpenAI release ChatGPT-5? Will antibiotic sales for farmed animals increase? Will inflation continue to moderate? Will Oppenheimer win Best Picture? (It would have Bohr’s vote, if he were a member of the Academy and if he were alive.) But we don’t just make blind predictions. In keeping with the best practices of forecasters, we attach probabilities to each of our predictions. Pay attention to the probabilities! 80 percent, or even 90 percent, does not mean we are certain an event will definitely happen. (If we were, we would say 100 percent.) Rather, it means that if we made five predictions or 10 predictions, we’d expect four or nine of them to come true, respectively. And as we have every year, we’ll be keeping track of how we do in 2024 and letting you know our performance. (You can check out how we did in 2023 here.) —Bryan Walsh Predicting a presidential race a year out is tough. As political scientists Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien have noted, “polls from the beginning of the election year have virtually no predictive power” when it comes to calling presidential races. People still respond to the state of the economy the year the election is held and the new facts they learn about the candidates as campaigns progress. A better approach than using polling is to reference some of the forecasting models political scientists have developed for predicting elections in advance. But many of these rely on data that’s only available mid-year, like presidential approval ratings or economic growth in the first half of the year. The one exception is a model from political scientist Jay DeSart, which does state-by-state predictions of outcomes based on prior voting habits of the state and the national polling average in October of the year prior to the election. I plugged October 2023’s head-to-head Biden/Trump polls into the model and found that it predicts a healthy Trump victory (297 electoral votes to 241), with the median forecast seeing Biden lose Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin but hang on to Michigan. But it’s a narrow advantage. The polls I relied on showed an average Trump lead of 0.2 points. A swing of less than 2 points in the polls would lead to a prediction of a Biden victory. So while I think the public’s lackluster mood toward the economy and Biden’s relative unpopularity put him at a disadvantage going into 2024, it’ll be a nail-biter for sure. This, of course, assumes Trump will be on the ballot, and the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling disqualifying him puts that in some doubt. But I don’t think much doubt; as Andrew Prokop explained for Vox, the likely outcome here is that the Supreme Court rules on whether Trump’s participation in the January 6, 2021, insurrection disqualifies him from the ballot, and I cannot envision the Court ruling against Trump, both because of its partisan leanings and out of fear of Trump supporter backlash delegitimizing the Court. —Dylan Matthews The 2024 Senate map is absolutely brutal for Democrats. They are defending 23 seats to only 11 held by Republicans, and only two of the latter (in Florida and Texas) are remotely competitive. Democrats don’t stand much of a chance of regaining the seats they lost six years ago in deep-red Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota, and challenging Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) will be expensive and difficult. Florida is trending Republican, and Texas hasn’t elected a Democrat to statewide office in three decades. Democrats, by contrast, are without a doubt losing a seat (the one Joe Manchin is vacating in West Virginia), and the Cook Political Report lists three others as tossups: the reelection bids of Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and the three-way race between independent Krysten Sinema, Democrat Ruben Gallego, and an as yet undetermined Republican in Arizona. Tester and Brown are both in states that Trump won in 2020 by wide margins, and both won very narrowly six years ago. Democrats have a 51-49 majority right now, and the loss of West Virginia will narrow that to 50-50. So for Republicans to regain control, they either need to win the presidency (letting Donald Trump’s vice president break the 50-50 tie) or beat either Tester, Brown, or Gallego/Sinema. That’s before considering the several seats where Democrats are narrowly favored (in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Michigan) but could still be vulnerable. Simply put: There are many, many ways for Republicans to retake the Senate. Everything has to go right simultaneously for Democrats to keep it. That makes for high odds of Republican capture. —DM Republicans currently hold a margin in the House nearly as razor-thin as the Democrats’ lead in the Senate. After George Santos’s expulsion in December, Republicans held 221 seats, just three above the bare minimum needed for a majority. If they lose five seats in November (or four and also lose Santos’s seat in the special election on February 13), they’re toast. There are a few reasons to think Republicans will do slightly worse than they did in 2022, just enough to lose the House. Among the most important is a recent court ruling in New York ordering a redistricting of the state’s House seats, which most observers think will favor Democrats. That offsets an effort in North Carolina to gerrymander in favor of Republicans. More importantly, House and presidential voting are becoming increasingly correlated, and that’s good news for Democrats. The 2022 midterms saw 18 Republicans elected from Biden-won districts, and only five Democrats elected in Trump-won districts. Redistricting scrambles those numbers somewhat (and Santos, one of the 18, is gone), but that suggests that Democrats have more obvious pickup opportunities than Republicans do in 2024. There’s still an easy-to-imagine world where Republicans hold the House, especially if Trump wins the presidential race and if he pulls out a popular vote victory this time. But Democrats have a modest leg up at this point. —DM In 2022, I predicted that inflation (measured by the Fed’s preferred metric) would stay below 3 percent; I was very wrong, as prices continued to rise at rates we hadn’t seen in decades. In 2023, I predicted inflation would stay above 3 percent; I was right, but inflation was falling rapidly by the end of the year. It looks like 2024 will actually enjoy the kind of low inflation I projected two years ago. Prices will probably rise moderately, and interest rates will remain pretty high, but the big spikes we saw a while back won’t return. The Federal Reserve Board’s range of estimates for the year is between 2.3 and 3 percent, with the median at 2.4 percent. The Survey of Professional Forecasters, which pulls together estimates from economists at banks and other private-sector entities, finds that on average they put 23.2 percent probability on prices rising by more than 3 percent between the fourth quarter of 2023 and that of 2024. I’m a little less confident than them, partly because the 2022 experience made me reduce my overall confidence in our collective ability to forecast price dynamics this far in advance. More to the point, the specific forces that drove prices high in 2022, like a semiconductor shortage and supply chain disruptions from Covid and the Ukraine war, do not seem likely to repeat next year. Then again, I didn’t see the Ukraine war coming, and it’s possible another curveball like that (maybe a Chinese incursion into Taiwan?) could send prices soaring. —DM Every year since the Covid-19 pandemic, the US has faced a dismal surge in car crash deaths. In 2021, for the first time since 2007, car fatalities surpassed 40,000, likely due to how Covid permanently altered America’s driving routines, among other factors. The most recent full year figures available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), from 2022, show that close to 43,000 Americans were killed by cars that year, and an early estimate for the first nine months of 2023 (January through September) shows more than 30,000 deaths over that period. I’d be surprised if 2023 traffic patterns differed enough from 2022 to bring us back to the pre-pandemic baseline (and the preliminary data is consistent with that hunch), so I predict that when NHTSA releases total 2023 car death figures, they’ll easily remain above 40,000. —Marina Bolotnikova Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel was an unprecedented calamity for the country, and many analysts think it will finally be the end of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Though he’s tried to place the blame elsewhere for the failure to protect Israelis, the people aren’t buying it: Polls keep showing that voters want him out — by a wide margin. In fact, the outrage being directed against him is so intense that some will find it weird that I’m only giving it 75 percent odds that he’ll be unseated in 2024. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned from my years living in and reporting on Israel, it’s that you should never underestimate Bibi’s canny campaigning and his ability to rise from the political ashes. We’ve seen it happen before. It is conceivable that he manages to cling to power for yet another term. Still, I think if ever there was a time when he could be pushed out, it’s now. —Sigal Samuel Future Perfect has repeatedly predicted that the coming year will be warmer than the previous one, giving it 80 percent odds. As my colleague Kelsey Piper has noted, “This is based on looking at the last 25 years of atmospheric temperature data: On average, in four out of five years, this prediction would be right.” With the continued burning of fossil fuels that cause climate change, it should come as no surprise that 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded. And 2024 will probably be even hotter, in part because of El Niño, the warm phase of the Pacific Ocean’s temperature pattern. In fact, experts predict that 2024 may be the first year that the average global surface temperature tops 1.5 degrees Celsius above what it was in the pre-industrial period. —SS Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could reasonably claim to be the most popular democratically elected leader in the world. According to Morning Consult’s weekly approval ratings of more than 20 democratic leaders, Modi’s net approval was a sky-high +60 among Indian voters as of late November, twice as high as the next most popular leader. And while other politicians around the world have seen their fortunes ebb and flow, Modi’s popularity has barely changed since the polls first became available in August 2019. That personal popularity has translated to electoral wins, most recently in state elections in December, where Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) achieved a sweeping victory in three heavily populated northern states. Beginning in April, hundreds of millions of Indian voters will go to the polls to pick their next government in the world’s largest election. Could Modi, who has been in power since 2014, lose? It’s possible — more than 20 opposition parties, including the BJP’s main opponent the Congress Party, formed the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance in July in an effort to present a unified opposition. But this election is easier to call than just about any other in 2024. I would be shocked if Modi doesn’t stay in power — and tighten his grip on it. In fact, the real question isn’t so much who will win the 2024 Indian elections, but whether we’ll see free and fair ones in the future. As my colleague Zack Beauchamp wrote in June, Modi has “systematically taken a hammer to the core institutions of Indian democracy.” From manipulating judges to controlling the press to undermining the machinery of elections, Modi is pushing the boundaries on how authoritarian a leader can become while still being “democratically elected.” Add in the allegations that Indian intelligence ordered the assassination of a Canadian citizen in Canada, and tried to do the same in the US, and 2024 is set to be a watershed year for India and its democracy — whatever the outcome of the spring’s election. —BW If the US election in 2024 will be close, our neighbor to the south will probably see a resounding landslide. Current polling suggests the overwhelming favorite is Claudia Sheinbaum, an engineering professor and climate researcher who until recently served as mayor of Mexico City. She is the nominee of the left-wing Morena party and a longtime ally of the party’s founder and leading figure, incumbent President Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador. AMLO, as he is known by the Mexican public, remains wildly popular, which is especially notable at a time when Covid-19 and inflation have cratered the popularity of many incumbent governments. Being his preferred successor gives Sheinbaum an incredible edge. She’s not the intensely charismatic firebrand that her mentor is, but the fact that she remains roughly 20 points ahead of her nearest rival when that rival has the support of all three major opposition parties — parties that have historically fought each other tooth and nail but united to take down AMLO and Morena — makes me think she has this in the bag. —DM As of this writing, Russia controls the red portions of Ukraine’s territory: In 2014, Russia seized Crimea and used separatist militias to establish two puppet regimes in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. When it began a full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022, it was able to seize the land between these two areas, establishing a “land bridge” that allowed it to run supplies between its two major footholds in Ukraine. Russia is also linked to Crimea by the Kerch Bridge and can use that to supply troops in Crimea as well, but Ukraine understandably keeps blowing that bridge up. Breaking the “land bridge,” then, has become a major goal of the Ukrainian military. If they can lead an offensive through the middle of Russian-held territory, they can split the Russian zone in two, and perhaps even enable a blockade of Crimea that could force the peninsula to yield. That would then free up resources to regain control of Russian-occupied land to the east. It’s a good goal, but to date, Ukraine has struggled to achieve it. The much anticipated 2023 offensive by Ukrainian forces was mostly a bust, failing to change the frontlines appreciably. The proliferation of drones providing reconnaissance for both sides has made it more challenging to launch surprise attacks, effectively providing an advantage to the defending side. That’s good for retaining Ukrainian control over the majority of its territory, but bad for retaking land Russia has claimed. We’re not at a point of total battlefield surveillance, though, and more modest changes in the frontlines are possible. It’s also possible that one or the other side develops effective enough signal-jamming approaches that they can deny their enemy the ability to use drones, which could enable rapid movement. But I think the existing dynamics of the war make a severing of the land bridge unlikely in the next year. —DM After publishing some promising study results, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) recently filed for FDA approval of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. Now the two questions are: Will the FDA grant its approval, and if so, will it do so by the end of 2024? For my prediction to come true, we need a “yes” to both. I am pretty confident MDMA will get the green light because in addition to the strong study results (and MAPS and the FDA agreed in advance on the study design), there is now robust public support for trying innovative methods to help people with mental health issues. A 2022 letter from the Health and Human Services Department disclosed that President Biden’s administration anticipates regulators will approve MDMA for PTSD and psilocybin for depression within the next two years. But the FDA is, um, not exactly known for speed. If it views the MAPS filing as complete, it will aim to render a decision in six to 10 months. But because this is a psychedelic drug we’re talking about, we may see extra risk evaluations, which could drag out the timeline. So although I think approval is likely in late 2024, I won’t give this prediction more than 85 percent odds. —SS A company that fires its CEO, promotes an interim CEO, then hires a new CEO, then experiences a total company rebellion, then brings back the original CEO, all within a week, is a company that is inherently hard to predict. And that’s especially true given that divisions over AI safety and the rate at which OpenAI was commercializing its products played at least some role in that internal division. It might make sense for OpenAI to take a beat and get its stuff together before unleashing the next full version of ChatGPT upon the world. But the former and future OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is nothing if not ambitious, and we know the company has been working on ChatGPT-5. (For the purposes of this prediction, OpenAI will need to release a product called “ChatGPT-5” — no “ChatGPT-4.5 Turbo” or whatever.) If anything, 75 percent might be a bit low. The good people at Metaculus currently have September 2024 as their median forecast for when ChatGPT-5 will be released. My hesitancy largely stems from the possibility that in the aftermath of the management implosion, OpenAI might take the opportunity to be more deliberate with its commercial rollouts. That said, given the increasing competition in the large language model arena — and the need to generate revenue to cover the crippling cost of all that computing — OpenAI will probably continue its evolution into an actual tech company and just keep shipping. —BW Last year, I predicted that Starship, SpaceX’s newest and biggest rocket system, would reach orbit. It did not, but its two test flights in 2023 nonetheless registered some progress, with the second passing through the Kármán line and becoming the most powerful vehicle ever to reach outer space. The orbit prediction was flawed not just because it was wrong, but because it was an ill-chosen threshold on my part. Even if the test flights SpaceX conducted had totally succeeded by the company’s own standards, the craft would not have entered orbit or made it a full rotation around the Earth. A more meaningful standard would be a test where neither the first nor second stage of the rocket is lost due to an explosion or “unscheduled rapid disassembly,” to use the term SpaceX employed to describe the fate of the second stage during the second test flight this year. Ultimately, the goal is for Starship to be fully reusable and each part of it recoverable for future launches. That said, Elon Musk has indicated that recovery is a secondary priority to getting the system to a point where it can successfully launch satellites. My prediction will be met even if test flights do not result in the first or second stages being recovered in reusable form, or even fully intact. They can break apart on contact with the water. But they can’t explode due to the rocket’s flight termination system or some error during the flight like out-of-control ignition of fuel. Everything has to go as planned while the rockets are going up, even if they aren’t recognizable once they make it back down. —DM It has been over four years since Elon Musk unveiled the design of the Tesla Cybertruck, a disastrous event that culminated in lead designer Franz von Holzhausen attempting to show off how tough the vehicle’s “armor glass” windows were and smashing them in the process. This past November, Tesla finally unveiled the “finalized” model of the truck to auto journalists and other observers, and it’s as ridiculous as promised. It’s still boxy, still looks like a poorly rendered car from a Nintendo 64 game, and it still has a single, nearly 4-foot-long “monowiper” to clean the windshield. (Will the wiper snap in half at the first sight of inclement weather? TBD!) The first trucks were delivered to consumers on November 30. But knowing Tesla and Musk, and knowing that this truck was first promised to be available in 2021, that seems more like a publicity stunt than the beginning of the vehicle’s general availability. I have serious doubts about the likelihood of the model ramping up production enough to fill more than a small fraction of existing orders. The company is already saying that the base model will not be available until 2025, and I expect delays on the higher-end all-wheel-drive models currently being promised for 2024. I’m not too confident in this prediction; Tesla has more experience producing electric vehicles than any other company on earth, and that makes me think there’s a real chance they can figure out how to make this thing at scale. But they also have a well-earned reputation for overpromising and underdelivering, which I think is the likely outcome for the Cybertruck. —DM As of this writing, there are two US cities where average people can download an app from the Alphabet-owned firm Waymo and get a ride from a self-driving taxi that doesn’t even have a human driver in it as backup: San Francisco and Phoenix. Waymo, formerly the self-driving division of Google, has long been a leader in this space, and has shot forward after the General Motors-owned Cruise was banned from SF following an incident in which a pedestrian was trapped under one of its vehicles. Cruise then announced it was suspending all US operations to “earn public trust,” and its CEO quit in due course. Cruise’s travails mean Waymo is now the uncontested king of self-driving in the US, at least for the moment. “If Waymo can perfect its technology, it could have time to establish market dominance,” my former Vox colleague Timothy Lee writes, who, along with the Verge’s Andrew Hawkins, is one of the people I trust most on self-driving cars. Establishing market dominance requires expansion, and Waymo seems set to expand in 2024. It has established customer waitlists in Austin and Los Angeles, and offered a brief “tour” in the latter city this year where ordinary customers could try it. I’m predicting that at least one new city — probably Austin or Los Angeles, but anything’s possible I suppose — will reach the status of San Francisco and Phoenix in 2024, where ordinary people can download the Waymo One app and order a ride. Because of high demand, the company still rations out invite codes needed to use the app, but anecdotally those are pretty easy to get (you can DM Waymo on Twitter/X and usually get one). I assume they’ll do the same in new cities. But I’m guessing that several thousand more people are going to be using robotaxis routinely in 2024 than in 2023. —DM Almost 70 percent of medically important antibiotics sold in the US go to the livestock sector in an attempt to ward off disease in unsanitary factory farms, giving rise to antibiotic-resistant “superbugs” which in turn make antibiotics less effective for humans. The World Health Organization has gone as far as to call on meat producers to phase out routine antibiotic use in livestock and only administer them when animals get sick. New US Food and Drug Administration rules set in the mid-2010s led to a dramatic drop in antibiotic sales for livestock, but they’ve ticked back up since 2017. I predict that trend will have continued in 2023 (the FDA will release sales data for 2023 at the end of 2024). I could be wrong, given that a lot of antibiotics are fed to cattle and beef production is expected to have fallen almost 5 percent in 2023. The pork industry buys a lot of antibiotics, too, and their production is expected to increase only 1 percent in 2023. Turkey producers make up a small but growing share of antibiotic sales, and production is expected to have increased almost 5 percent in 2023. That should all lead to about a 1 percent overall decrease in antibiotic sales for 2023, but the amount of antibiotics purchased by meat producers doesn’t neatly correspond with production levels. For example, in 2022, the growth in antibiotic sales for beef and pork far outpaced the growth in actual pork and beef production. So, I’m going to predict an increase of at least one percent. —KT Oatly makes, in my opinion, the tastiest plant-based milk on the market. A lot of people agree, and the company took the dairy alternative sector by storm in the late 2010s. The fervor drove the company to go public in May 2021 with a stock price debut of $17 per share, which peaked at almost $29 that summer. Since then, it’s been in free fall. It’s now just a little over $1 per share, and earlier this year, it went under 50 cents per share. The company has been plagued by manufacturing shortages and inefficiencies, and a wave of imitators. Oatly pretty much created oat milk in the 1990s, but once it started to become popular, every company that was making plant milk from soy, almonds, and other ingredients began making milk from oats, too. In other words, it’s partly a victim of its own success. In its quarter three financials released in November, it reported just a 2.5 percent revenue increase year over year, with sales shooting up in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, slightly declining in the Americas, and dropping sharply by 31 percent in Asia. It just opened its first production facility in China, which could help it turn things around in the region where it’s arguably poised for the most growth. That said, global plant-based milk sales were still growing last year, and the company has a better product and branding than its competitors. But I’m skeptical it’ll be enough to help the company ramp up its revenue. —KT From the start of 2015 to the end of 2023, the share of US eggs from cage-free chickens leapt from around 6 percent to 39 percent. It was the result of persistent campaigning from animal welfare advocates that stretched back to the early 2000s — primarily lobbying state legislatures, passing statewide ballot measures, and persuading food corporations to change their animal welfare policies. (Disclosure: I worked on the issue on and off from 2012 to 2017 at animal welfare nonprofits prior to joining Vox.) The share of hens raised cage-free has grown by about 5 percent each year since 2019, but I’m going to predict we’ll see a slightly bigger percentage growth — 6 percent — in 2023 for two reasons. The first is that three state laws requiring all eggs sold in the state to be cage-free come into effect on January 1, 2024, in Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. Their populations combined account for around 5 percent of US egg consumption. Even more state laws go into effect at the start of 2025, covering around 7 percent of US egg consumption. However, I’m not predicting a 12 percent increase because some of those states’ egg supply is already cage-free. Plus, some of the ramp-up to these laws may already be reflected in recent data or won’t be reflected in the end of 2024 data. Second, most food corporations that committed to going cage-free set a 2025 deadline. Many companies have or will meet it, but many won’t, especially grocers, which sell a big portion of the US egg supply. Two of the biggest — Kroger and Walmart — have already backed away from their 2025 deadlines. But speaking from experience, nothing spurs action better than a deadline, so we may see companies inch closer to their goal than they did in previous years. The switch from a cage farm to a cage-free farm represents just a marginal improvement for a hen’s life, but it’s remarkable that a tiny, poorly funded movement has been able to change a fundamental practice of a massive industry. I’ll bet that in 2024, the rate of change will be a little faster than in recent years. —KT 2022 was the worst year ever for avian flu in the US. The outbreak tore through giant chicken and turkey factory farms throughout the country, resulting in the mass extermination (using, it’s worth emphasizing, the cruelest kill method imaginable) of more than 57 million birds. Last year, Future Perfect predicted that 2023 bird flu deaths would again exceed 50 million, which didn’t quite come true. As of this writing (December 21), only about 19 million poultry birds have been culled in 2023, bringing the total from the bird flu outbreak that began in 2022 to about 77 million. Nearly all of those 2023 killings took place in the last couple months of the year, which means that we’re currently in a big resurgence of the disease (consistent with its seasonal transmission pattern). The number of birds culled between October and the end of 2023 was more than double the number from the same period the previous year, which tells me avian flu is heavily ramping up right now rather than slowing down, as it was in late 2022. But the flow of animal diseases can be pretty surprising, so with all that in mind, I predict with medium confidence that by the end of this year, the 2024 death toll from bird flu will exceed 20 million. —MB This past November, animal rights activist Wayne Hsiung was convicted and sentenced to jail time for his role in mass actions at two California factory farms in 2018 and 2019. The group Hsiung co-founded in 2013, Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), has fueled a resurgence of the radical wing of the animal rights movement, with risky tactics including trespassing at factory farms and rescuing animals suffering there. Hsiung’s jail sentence was the first one ever for DxE, and I think there will soon be more. This year, he and two other activists, Eva Hamer and Paul Darwin Picklesimer, will face trial in Madison, Wisconsin, for entering a facility that breeds beagles for animal testing and rescuing three of the dogs in 2017. I think at least one conviction and jail or prison sentence is more likely than any other individual outcome (the others include acquittal, conviction with no jail time, a deadlocked jury, or the case getting dropped or delayed by prosecutors), though my confidence is quite low because jury trials can be very unpredictable. In October 2022, for example, Hsiung and Picklesimer were acquitted for rescuing two piglets from pork giant Smithfield Foods in a historic trial in a very conservative Utah county. Madison (where I live!) is ultra-progressive by comparison, and it’s adorable beagles, rather than food animals, that are at the heart of the case. I’ll be watching the trial closely and will definitely keep readers apprised. —MB If you didn’t cry during the womanhood montage in Barbie set to Billie Eilish’s melancholic crooning, you didn’t do the movies right, I’m afraid. But in all seriousness, the Gen Z icon has a pretty strong track record at the Grammys. She holds seven Grammys, one of which was for her James Bond song, “No Time to Die.” If there’s anything Billie does especially well, it’s an emotional ballad for a movie! It also doesn’t hurt that “What Was I Made For?” was nominated across five categories. I will be shocked if her girl sadness anthem doesn’t get another win under her belt next month. —Izzie Ramirez 2023 was Schiaparelli’s year! Beyoncé’s Renaissance Tour featured this custom moment from the haute couture brand, and who could forget rapper Doja Cat’s controversial, head-to-toe scarlet bedazzled look? Kylie Jenner is already a fan of Schiaparelli, wearing a glittery gold gown earlier this year, and Kim Kardashian wore the brand at the 2023 Met Gala. Given that the gala and accompanying exhibition’s theme for 2024 — “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” — is centered around the sensory qualities and ephemeral nature of a garment prior to being archived, I truly believe one of the Kardashians or Jenner family members will roll up to the steps of the Met adorned in Schiaparelli. Creative director Daniel Roseberry has revitalized the fashion house with edge, a keen sense of humor, and plenty of historical nods to the brand’s founder, Elsa Schiaparelli. There are a lot of motifs to choose from, ranging from the surreal anatomic iconography to the groundbreaking lobster dress. While I don’t quite think the Kardashian-Jenners will repeat wearing an archival piece given the hoopla around Kim in Marilyn Monroe’s dress, Schiaparelli will certainly be up to the artistic and technological challenge of bringing the gala’s theme to life. It’s just a matter of choosing between Kim, Kylie, Kendall, Khloe, Kourtney, or Kris. —IR Did any of the other likely nominees for Best Picture successfully simulate a nuclear explosion on film without the use of CGI? Let’s see … Martin Scorcese’s three-hour and 26-minute 1920s epic Killers of the Flower Moon? Nope.

Honestly, I’m not sure — I took my 6-year-old son to the film and he demanded we leave once Kate McKinnon’s Weird Barbie showed up about 20 minutes in. I think he had his first existential crisis. The bottom line? The Academy loves biopics, it loves period pieces, and for some reason, it weirdly loves modern films that feature black-and-white scenes. J.

That is not hyperbole. In 2023, Ohtani recorded a WAR stat of 10.1, a full 16 percent higher than the next-best player. (WAR means “wins above replacement,” and it calculates how many more game wins an individual player is worth than a totally average player at the same position. It’s basically the stat to rule all stats for Moneyball heads.) But what’s really amazing is that while Ohtani wasn’t the best hitter or best pitcher by WAR rankings, he was the only player in baseball who did both. He hits baseballs a long way, and he strikes lots of guys out. No one in baseball has done that since … Babe Ruth. Those unique skills earned Ohtani the largest contract in sports history, with the Los Angeles Dodgers paying him $700 million for 10 years. (It also comes with some unique elements, including the fact that Ohtani will actually defer $680 million of that $700 million until after the 10 years of his contract is completed, which apparently is legal?) That sets him up for some sky-high expectations in the 2024 season. Because of an injury last season, Ohtani won’t be able to pitch in 2024, which means he’ll be focused exclusively on hitting. He was already on pace for 51 home runs last year before his injury, which would have put him just behind the major league lead in that category. I think he has an excellent chance to lead the league in homers in 2024 — and without the distraction of pitching, I’d even give him an outside chance to break Barry Bonds (just ever so slightly steroid-tainted) major league record of 70.

175570107,‘It’s a nightmare’: Landlords in a bind as France imposes tough new emissions rules,"Michelle Bassano owns a desirable asset: a top-floor studio apartment she rents out in an almost 200-year-old building in the historic Marais district of central Paris. But she is now thinking of walking away as the issue of trying to meet France’s strict new energy efficiency standards is proving too challenging. “It is a nightmare,” said Bassano. “I’m thinking of just selling.” Bassano’s neighbours in the jointly-owned building refuse to ratify the roughly €100,000 needed to replace and insulate the zinc roof. Adding insulation to the stone facade outside is banned by historical preservation mandates – yet insulating the inside would mean losing precious space in the 25sq m (269sq ft) flat and cutting into its resale value. Landlords across France are grappling with looming restrictions on renting out poorly insulated apartments and homes under strict new rules that phase in gradually from 2023. They aim to incentivise owners to renovate roughly two-thirds of France’s 37 million homes by 2050. President Emmanuel Macron’s government argues that widescale renovations are needed to address a big source of greenhouse gas emissions: buildings account for almost half of French energy consumption and a third of carbon emissions, while two-thirds of that total comes from homes. Experts say his government’s intervention is unique in Europe. The new rules pose a particular problem for apartment buildings and historic homes like many in Paris, along with picturesque villages from Provence to Alsace. Homes in the Marais are doomed to remain in the bottom half of the government’s energy rating system even with renovations, say experts. Critics are already warning of unintended consequences: they say the policy may worsen France’s housing shortage and could even spark social unrest as high inflation also hits households. Jean-Claude Bassien, deputy chief executive of property group Nexity, thinks the government’s approach is the right one but that the timetable is “unrealistic and absurd”. “We will need more time if we want to do this well and avoid a repeat of the gilets jaunes,” he added, referring to protests, named for the yellow jackets worn by demonstrators, that rocked France in 2018 over a proposed carbon tax on petrol. To incentivise renovations, owners are required to get properties rated for energy efficiency, classifying them from A (best) to G (worst), before they can be sold or rented out. The regulations offer both carrot and stick: poorly insulated homes will gradually be excluded from the rental market over the next decade, but public money is available to help pay for insulation, new windows or upgraded heating. Landlords of F- and G-rated homes may no longer raise rents, and as of this year, the worst of the G-rated properties cannot be rented to new tenants. By 2028, 5.2 million homes rated F and G, or 17 per cent of total housing stock, will become ineligible for rental. By 2034, all E and D rated properties will be excluded, amounting to more than half of all homes. Even some in Macron’s camp worry that the approach is too draconian. Finance minister Bruno Le Maire hinted that he supported softening the rules, but was then forced to backpedal. While countries across Europe are trying a range of policies to decarbonise and boost the energy efficiency of homes, none have tried what France is doing, said Boris Cournède, a policy expert at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. “Everyone is looking at the French example, to see how it plays out,” he said. “It’s a good idea on paper even if it’s a bit early to judge the results.” In Germany, the government has taken a different approach, including banning gas boilers – a politically contentious measure – and creating a carbon dioxide tax on home heating. Belgium and Austria have tweaked regulations to facilitate renovations of multi-owner apartment buildings. France has pledged to increase subsidies for home renovations to almost €5 billion from €3.4 billion last year. But a Green party-led Senate report argued much more funding was needed – one estimate puts the requirement closer to €25 billion a year. Accessing the cash available is not always easy, with a long application process and complex rules. Gilles Lambert has applied for about €10,000 in subsidies to renovate a 1980s building he owns with four rental apartments in a leafy Paris suburb. “The application has been a complicated obstacle course,” said the 62-year-old. In the meantime, two of his flats have been banned from the market. Real estate agents and property management companies have warned that the rules may aggravate housing shortages in cities such as Marseille, Bordeaux and Lyon by shrinking the pool of homes to rent. Édouard Philippe, Macron’s former prime minister and now mayor of Le Havre, said excluding low-rated homes would “mechanically reduce rental options for low-income people”. Another concern is that rent control rules in key cities will make it difficult for owners to garner an acceptable return on renovations where they do carry them out. In Paris, renovations have become a flashpoint within jointly owned apartment buildings, known as copropriétés, because costly projects require majority approval, while a unanimous vote is needed to take out loans. Laure Gallard has been lobbying her neighbours in a 10-unit, 1920s building to hire an expert to map out the renovations it needs, but has had little success. “I think they are in denial because they do not want to know and are afraid of the cost that lies ahead of us,” said the 34-year-old architect. Some owners of F- or G-rated homes are simply trying to sell. According to real estate website Se Loger, almost 20 per cent of the homes for sale in the first half of 2023 were poorly insulated ones, double the level in 2021. Thomas Lefebvre, data scientist at Se Loger, said there was no guarantee that buyers would renovate. “If we’re just removing homes from the rental market without spurring renovations, then it’s not really a win for the environment,” he said. Jacques Baudrier, a deputy mayor in Paris in charge of construction, refuses to despair. The city has spent some €2.5 billion in 10 years to renovate public buildings and schools, and plans to update all low-income housing by 2050. “We’ve made a lot of progress in the public sector, but in the private housing market, things are going far too slowly,” he said. The city has been holding monthly workshops in town halls to inform people about subsidies and offer advice. At one event in June, some 600 people came to trade tips on insulation, shutters, and heating and cooling systems. “Initially people were really worried,” said Baudrier, “but now they are getting into it”. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023 Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phoneFind The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to dateOur In The News podcast is now published daily - Find the latest episode here",https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2024/01/01/its-a-nightmare-landlords-in-a-bind-as-france-imposes-tough-new-emissions-rules/,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/mD4qKGFgp_FwfJVhtvrMxOap0wg=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/V2Z6Z2ZN65AG3EZUZZU5WUF37A.jpg,2024-01-01 13:00:00,Leila Abboud,['Leila Abboud'],en,ie,-0.093
175581001,ICOS president: 2024 is the year to address &#8216;water quality&#8217; issues,"One of the key issues that will dominate 2024 for Ireland’s farming communities is “water quality”, according to the president of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society (ICOS). The Co. Tipperary dairy farmer, Edward Carr – who took up the role of president of ICOS in 2023 – said that it is crucially important that water quality is “stabilised” as part of Ireland’s campaign to retain a nitrates derogation, after the current derogation expires on January 1, 2026. He believes that Irish farmers are completely committed to improving water quality and protecting the environment. “There are big challenges and every farmer recognises that – there are environmental issues, and there are constraints and that is a daily factor of life now, but farmers have embraced a range of actions and adopted new initiatives – they have not stood still when it comes to the environment and what is being asked of them. “Farmers know they have to get it right when it comes to water quality not only because it is the key to securing another nitrates derogation but because that is what we all want to do – we want to improve water quality and we are also working hard on climate change challenges. “We’re on course to achieve the 2030 emission reduction targets for agriculture, and we’re probably the only industry in Ireland that’s going to come anywhere near achieving that,” Carr added. Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands are currently the only EU member states to have a nitrates derogation. Denmark’s derogation permitting a maximum stocking rate of 230 kg [of organic nitrogen (N)/ha] expires in July 2024, and the country is currently involved in discussions about an extension to the derogation. Meanwhile, the Netherlands’ derogation is set to be phased out by the end of 2025. Next year, the Netherlands will be permitted a maximum stocking rate of up to 210 kg N/ha in “nutrient polluted areas” and 230 kg N/ha in other areas. These values are set to drop further in 2025, and there will be no derogation in place in the Netherlands after December 2025. According to Carr, this change in direction across Europe highlights why water quality will play such a key role in Ireland’s next discussions to secure a new nitrates derogation. But, in the first instance he said that the reduction in the maximum limit for derogation farmers to 220 kg N/ha from today (January 1, 2024) will create significant challenges for some. “There will clearly be consequences that will be felt right across agriculture, because it will impact on family farms, and it is what those implications will be in 2024 that we now have to prepare for,” he warned. According to Carr, 2023 was a very difficult year for many farming families – for dairy farmers the drop in milk prices was hard to bear coming off record prices the year before, across the board input prices remained stubbornly high in some areas, and weather conditions proved frustrating throughout the year. On top of that, the president of ICOS said many farmers felt that there was an air of negativity around farming in relation to environmental challenges. Carr hopes that 2024 will be a more positive year for farming communities on a number of fronts. “It would be nice for farmers to get the recognition they deserve in 2024 for the work they do, for what they produce and for the changes they are making to protect the environment. “Yes, there are challenges and we all have to work together to meet those challenges, but I am hoping that it will be a positive year for farmers. We saw coming towards the end of 2023 how commodity markets were improving, and that should be a good sign for the year ahead,” he added.",https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/icos-president-2024-is-the-year-to-address-water-quality-issues/,https://cdn.agriland.ie/uploads/2023/07/Riversunshine.jpeg,2024-01-01 13:00:00,Francess McDonnell,['Francess McDonnell'],en,ie,-0.191
175678975,Mental hospitals warehoused the sick. Congress wants to let them try again.  - POLITICO,"“It is no longer the 1960s, and there is no longer the same stigma against the treatment of mental health,” said GOP Rep. Michael Burgess, a doctor representing Dallas’ affluent northern suburbs who sponsored a House bill to change the rule. The House passed it Dec. 12. It would give states the option to treat Medicaid patients suffering from addiction for up to a month in a mental hospital on the government’s dime. The Senate Finance Committee approved a similar provision in November, so its prospects of enactment are good. Burgess’ co-sponsor was Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York City’s poorest section, the South Bronx, who has spent time in the hospital for his own mental health struggles. Public health groups including the Treatment Advocacy Center and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, as well as state Medicaid directors, support the change. They say the 1965 rule barring Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and lower-middle income, from funding hospital treatment has had unintended consequences: a lack of psychiatric beds for people who need them. Instead, they said, many vulnerable people end up on the streets, in emergency rooms, in jails or dead. They say the policy also perpetuates discrimination against people who suffer from drug addiction and mental illness compared to those with physical conditions, for which there’s no such exclusion. Republicans in Congress agree. Democrats are divided. New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee that shepherded the bill, resisted the change, wary of a return to institutionalizing people with mental illness instead of caring for them in their homes, ideally, with a team of specialized health and social workers. “We know that one of the best ways to help people in recovery is to ensure they have access to care in their communities,” he said. Pallone ultimately relented because Republicans agreed to improve Medicaid coverage for some incarcerated people with substance use disorder. But fears of reinstitutionalization have also animated civil rights advocates who support the restriction on Medicaid funds. They fear a slippery slope back to warehousing the sick and point to states like California and New York that are already experimenting with forcing patients into care. Lifting the Medicaid rule would reduce pressure to do what’s really needed, said Lewis Bossing, senior staff attorney at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law: increase services in communities. “People have better outcomes in terms of reduced hospitalization rates, reduced criminal legal system involvement, increased employment, increased measures of social integration when they’re served in the community, … versus having to be at an institution to get care,” he said. The rise and fall of the mental hospital States started building mental health hospitals in the 1800s, aiming to provide people with severe mental illness with care instead of throwing them in jail. But the hospitals soon became overcrowded, understaffed and underfinanced. Abuse was rife, according to an investigation published in Life Magazine in 1946: Patients were restrained for days, thrown into solitary confinement, starved and sometimes beaten to death. More than half a million people were in state mental health hospitals in 1963, half of them in facilities housing more than 3,000 people, President John F. Kennedy said in a speech that year. Kennedy laid out a plan for states to build comprehensive community mental health centers, with federal support. They would combine diagnostic services, emergency psychiatric units, inpatient and outpatient services and rehabilitation. The law establishing Medicaid two years later prohibited federal money from paying for care in mental health care facilities with more than 16 beds to avoid pouring money into what Kennedy called outdated institutional care. The rule now covers people between 21 and 64 years old. Many state hospitals closed but the community mental health system, as Kennedy envisioned it, never came to fruition, advocates on both sides of the debate say. Those who don’t want the Medicaid funding ban repealed would like states and the federal government to focus on building that system, while those who want to see the policy gone say both community and hospital care are needed to provide people with what they need, depending on their circumstances. A person diagnosed with mental illness and substance use disorder needs inpatient care for doctors to stabilize them, argued Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a gastroenterologist and top member of the two committees with power over the policy. “The people who were so opposed to this because they still want to do it in an outpatient [facility], you wonder if they’ve ever actually lived with somebody who is seriously psychotic,” Cassidy said. Over the last decade, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has started allowing states to use federal dollars to pay for care in mental health hospitals for a limited time, as long as they obtain a waiver. Thirty-six states now have a waiver to treat people with substance use disorder and a dozen states have a waiver for treating other mental illnesses in psychiatric hospitals. California found that its waiver to provide medication-assisted treatment for people with substance use disorder in mental hospitals helped individuals “who need a relatively intensive level of care for short-term stabilization of acute needs,” said Ann Carroll, the California Department of Health Care Services’ spokesperson. Even so, the system as it stands is failing to provide state-of-the-art care to many patients. One-third of the 1.5 million Medicaid enrollees with opioid use disorder, for example, did not receive medication treatment in 2021, according to the HHS inspector general. The 2018 SUPPORT Act, a landmark law meant to provide prevention, treatment and recovery for people with opioid addiction, gave states a new, albeit temporary, choice to provide care in psychiatric hospitals for up to a month without having to obtain a waiver. That option, which only South Dakota and Tennessee have taken, expired in September. The SUPPORT Act reauthorization bill the House passed in mid-December would reup the option and make it permanent. Pallone argued at a House Energy and Commerce hearing this summer that the low uptake showed that the waivers were sufficient. But Burgess and other Republicans said the waivers were burdensome and that making the option permanent would incentivize more states to use it. The Senate Finance Committee also voted in November to make the option permanent. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who introduced the legislation with Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, emphasized the 30-day limit and the requirement to provide medication. She described medication treatment — using drugs like buprenorphine to wean patients off stronger opioids — as “the gold standard for treating addiction.” It’s a rare issue on which Republicans aren’t at odds with the public health establishment. A repeal of the funding ban wouldn’t mean a return to the 1965 mental health care model “because that is just not where the system is today, that’s not where the clinical understanding is today and that’s not where any of the conversation is today,” said Jack Rollins, the director of federal policy at the National Association of Medicaid Directors. Forced care and the slippery slope But there’s still a powerful perception among many in the public that mental hospitals are akin to prisons and that opening the door to voluntary care will lead to forced treatment. When some people think of mental hospitals, they see the one in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, or its 1975 film adaptation in which Jack Nicholson played a patient who was saner than the nurse caring for him. “A faulty assumption is that [mental health institutions] are like therapeutic settings. We know there’s a history in this country of institutions not being particularly therapeutic places,” Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law’s Bossing said. He pointed to reports in recent years from Washington’s disability rights watchdog alleging abuse and neglect at one public and one private mental health hospital in the capital. Representatives of the institutions said they were investigating the accusations and would make changes if necessary. In 2021, Virginia announced and quickly reversed a decision to close five of the state’s eight psychiatric hospitals to new admissions due to overcrowding and understaffing. And reinstitutionalization, albeit on a small scale, is happening. New York has sent about 130 people per week, involuntarily, to hospitals for psychiatric evaluation since May as part of a plan by Mayor Eric Adams to treat people who are unable to meet their basic needs. On the other side of the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has included ways to compel people into care in his mental health system overhaul. In March, Californians will decide on a $6.4 billion bond proposal Newsom has pitched to build nearly 25,000 psychiatric and addiction beds. Representatives of community mental health organizations in California plan to oppose the changes. In New York City, a group of civil rights lawyers filed a class-action suit against Adams’ directive and want more data on its implementation to see whether it’s disproportionately affecting people of color. Weighing the politics Still, Newsom and Adams are reacting to growing public and political pressure caused by a massive crisis of homelessness and drug addiction. Drug use spiked during the Covid pandemic, as evidenced by the record levels of fatal overdoses — now more than 100,000 a year. Homelessness rose by 12 percent between 2022 and 2023 nationwide as rents surged and pandemic-era aid ended. More than 650,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2023, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. California is home to the most unhoused people of any state — some 181,000 people — followed by New York, with some 103,000. Politicians fear open-air drug markets and tent encampments in their cities could hurt them at election time. And they’re increasingly confident that caring for more of those suffering on the streets in mental hospitals won’t become a similar political liability. “It doesn’t have to become a warehouse, you know, ‘One Flew Over a Cuckoo’s Nest’. Absolutely not. That’s wrong, it should not happen,” Cassidy said.",https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/01/mental-hospitals-drug-users-congress-00132671,https://static.politico.com/2c/6a/5ccb8abd4b3592b0babf52ab67b9/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1780559851,2024-01-01 13:00:00,Carmen Paun,['Carmen Paun'],en,us,0.007
175678977,2024 is a record year for world elections. Here’s what to watch.  - POLITICO,"“We will know whether democracy lives or dies by the end of 2024,” said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, founder of the investigative news site Rappler in the Philippines and author of “How to Stand Up to a Dictator.” In Europe, establishment parties are bracing for a potential surge from the far right within the European Parliament, including Euroskeptic groups that aim to undermine the EU institutions meant to maintain peace across the continent’s 27-member bloc. In Asia, Taiwan’s election could escalate tensions in the Indo-Pacific, threatening to drag in Washington and other allies as Taipei and Beijing increasingly butt heads over the disputed island. And in Africa, elections in Senegal, South Africa, Mali and Chad could shape the trajectory of multilateral institutions across the continent. In North America, the U.S. isn’t alone in facing a closely watched presidential race: Mexico is holding a vote that could impact cooperation on critical trade and fraught border security issues with its northern neighbor. Tony Banbury, president of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a non-governmental organization which tracks global votes, said while ”authoritarians are deploying a sophisticated playbook to gain and hold on to power,” he also sees “democratic forces are fighting back.” The bumper crop of elections also raises questions about new technologies and misinformation online, putting a strain on cybersecurity and social media efforts to mitigate risks of manipulation. “2024 will be an election year unlike any other and this will bring unprecedented challenges to online platforms who will be working to protect the integrity of elections online,” said Katie Harbath, who has advised Republican campaigns on digital strategy and previously worked as director of public policy at Facebook. “Not only will they have a lot of countries to cover — all with different languages, cultures and regulations — but new tools such as AI that they need to write new rules for.” U.S. headlines will be dominated by the domestic showdown. Here’s a look at other key elections to watch around the world. Washington’s Asian ally: Taiwan Taiwanese voters will head to the polls in 2024’s first major election to choose a new president on Jan. 13 amid deepening fears that China might invade the island, which Biden has repeatedly said Washington would help fend off. The frontrunner is Lai Ching-te, the current vice president from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Lai chose Taiwanese envoy to the U.S. Hsiao Bi-khim — also a close confidant of incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen — as his running mate. This sends a signal to Washington that with Hsiao at his side, Lai will continue Tsai’s measured policy toward Beijing and be mindful of U.S. concerns. Lai will face Hou Yu-ih, the standard-bearer for the Kuomintang party, which ruled Taiwan from the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 through 2000. The Kuomintang is more friendly to Beijing and explicitly advocates for “reunification” as a key plank of its party platform. Hou and his running mate, Jaw Shaw-kong, are warning that electing Lai and Hsiao would result in a war between China and Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory despite the fact the Chinese Communist Party has never ruled the island. Also running is centrist Ko Wen-je. Billionaire CEO of major tech supplier Foxconn, Terry Gou, ran as an independent, but dropped out of the race in November. Beijing despises Lai and Hsiao and has placed them and their families on (unenforceable) sanction lists for their pro-independence sympathies. China’s optimal election result is a Kuomingtang victory that would open the door to renewing and expanding cross-Strait economic links aimed at pulling the self-governing island closer into China’s orbit of influence. Washington follows a “One China Policy” hinged on the peaceful resolution of Taiwan’s status and opposes any move to change the cross-Strait status quo by force as Beijing has threatened, a policy that includes providing Taiwan defensive weaponry. Biden has stated multiple times that the U.S. would militarily intervene in a conflict between Taipei and Beijing, roiling already frayed ties with China. Africa’s democracy-defining elections Elections are set to be held across over a dozen countries in Africa, including in leading members of continental peace-keeping and economic organizations, as well as in countries where militaries overthrew democratically elected governments in coups in recent years. The outcomes of these elections will impact the brewing battle among foreign countries for influence on the continent, with the United States and Western allies vying to act as a counterweight to Russian and Chinese investment and security partnerships. It will also affect the trajectory of democratization and test the ability of multilateral organizations on the continent to protect civilian rule and discourage military coups. The governing parties of Senegal and South Africa are hoping to keep a grip on power, but face tough fights from opposition groups. Both are forceful voices in the African Union and Senegal is one of the leading countries in the Economic Community of West African States, organizations which hold considerable sway on regional priorities like trade integration, security policy and human rights. Senegal and South Africa hold weight on the continent as more economically prosperous and politically stable countries, helping to shape continental trade and political integration. South Africa’s election will also be economically significant — the ruling ANC party has embraced trade and investment ties with China and Russia as part of the BRICS alliance (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). The South African economy has also lagged under ANC mismanagement, exacerbating inequality and stagnation in one of the continent’s wealthiest countries. Mali and Chad — which have each been under military rule since coups over the past three years — have both said they would hold presidential elections in 2024. Mali’s junta initially set February for its ballot, but postponed it, while dates for elections in Chad have yet to be announced. If these elections occur, which is far from certain, that could encourage other African countries that have also experienced recent coups to move back toward democratic rule, including Niger, Gabon and Sudan. If they don’t, it will set back the yearslong efforts from ECOWAS and the African Union to restore civilian rule in those countries and undercut the legitimacy of the two organizations. Protests expected: Belarus, Russia, Iran Analysts don’t expect legislative elections in Belarus and Iran, or a presidential ballot in Russia, to immediately change policy in those countries, but protests are likely to emerge around these votes that could prove disruptive and hard to control. Such unrest could distract each government from their involvement in major international conflicts — for Iran, in the Middle East, for Russia and Belarus, in Ukraine. It could also further heighten tensions with Western countries, which have imposed sanctions over each country’s treatment of dissenters in recent years. When Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared victory in the widely contested 2020 presidential election, winning a sixth term in office, it prompted the biggest anti-government demonstrations the country had seen since the fall of the Soviet Union, spanning months. The opposition refuted the results, backed by international allies like the United States and EU. Four years later, concerns about Lukashenko’s authoritarianism have not abated, raising worries among critics that he could try to further consolidate power in the upcoming parliamentary vote in February, ahead of the next presidential ballot in 2025. Meanwhile, Lukashenko’s close ally Russian President Vladimir Putin is up for reelection himself on March 15, in a vote he’s widely expected to win after more than 20 years in power. Like Lukashenko, Putin is also expected to face protests. But one of his most vocal critics, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, is currently imprisoned and has had breaks in contact with his allies, hampering the ability of Putin’s detractors to organize. Iran’s election to fill seats in the Majlis on March 1 will be the country’s first vote since mass demonstrations in 2022 gripped the Islamic Republic following the death of a young woman who had been detained for allegedly not following state rules on proper dress. Disputed election results have fanned the flames of dissent in Iran in the past, including the 2009 Green Movement protests, considered at the time the biggest demonstrations since the 1979 revolution. Subcontinent strained: Pakistan and India Both Pakistan and India are heading into contentious elections in which the winners could reshape international relations, altering dynamics in the strategic Indo-Pacific region, where, like Africa, the U.S. and its allies hope to bolster ties as a bulwark against Chinese and Russian influence. India is set to hold general elections between April and May, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party is expected to hold on to its majority, if not gain seats, in the Lok Sabha. But India’s opposition parties accuse Modi of undermining the country’s democratic institutions, jailing and intimidating journalists and using state investigative agencies to target political opponents. They also accuse the BJP of sanctioning and condoning violence against India’s Muslim minority and promoting Hindutva, a school of Hindu nationalist thought that wants to cement Hindu hegemony in India. Modi and his allies have said the Indian government’s actions against journalists and activists are needed to combat “terrorism” by Islamist and Maoist groups. Pakistan, meanwhile, is still grappling with the aftermath of populist Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ousting. Khan, a famed cricket player, was first elected in 2018 and promoted better ties with India and China. He was removed from office in April 2022 after failing a no-confidence motion and was arrested in May 2023 on corruption charges, which sparked widespread protests at the time and continues to roil the South Asian country. Pakistan’s Parliament was dissolved last August ahead of anticipated elections in November. However, a dispute over the boundaries of some electoral constituencies prompted Pakistan’s electoral commission to delay the general election until February 2024. Strict new social media laws will be a factor in both countries’ campaigns after they each moved to rein in platforms in recent years under the auspices of combating disinformation, raising fears of censorship from some opposition forces. Continent-shaker: European Parliament The European Parliament election is the second-largest vote by population in 2024, behind India. Traditional parties are nervous that a possible rise on the European far right could coincide with a Trump comeback. That scenario could again rankle transatlantic ties that have just started to repair under Biden, complicating coordination with the continent’s closest ally as the European Union continues to face the Russia-Ukraine war on its doorstep. The shock success of populist, Euroskeptic leader Geert Wilders in The Netherlands was the most recent sign of tides turning, with polls pointing to major gains for far-right parties under the European Parliament’s Identity and Democracy group in the June vote. The European far-right has campaigned less on the anti-Islam, anti-migrant rhetoric that defined its early rise in the 2000s and 2010s, shifting its approach to domestic issues like housing and economic inequality in countries like Italy, Portugal, France, Germany and the Netherlands, helping them to make steady, and surprising, electoral gains. While Identity and Democracy parties aren’t expected to win the most seats in the Parliament vote, they’re currently running in third place — up from their current sixth — according to POLITICO’s Poll of Polls. This could give them fuel to push for prominent Parliament committee leadership posts, which they were blocked from taking after the prior 2019 election. It’s unlikely that most important positions will actually end up in the hands of the far-right. Italy’s far-right leader Giorgia Meloni, though, will be seeking an influential commissioner. A number of these parties’ leaders, including Wilders, have also expressed skepticism to continued Ukraine aid, presenting a potential clash with allies like the U.S. as the war against Russia drags on. The neighbor: Mexico Mexico is heading to the polls on June 2, in a presidential election that could have major consequences for collaboration with Washington on border issues, trade and broader policy toward the rest of Latin America. Incumbent President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is term-limited, but he’s looking to extend the hold on power of the populist, left-wing Morena party he founded. Under López Obrador, Mexico has regularly played hardball with the Trump and Biden administrations on border security and trade. Morena’s candidate and the current election frontrunner is former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, a scientist by training and close follower of López Obrador’s brand of economic populism. She’s expected to continue the current government’s social assistance programs to help Mexico’s impoverished urban communities, while pursuing a similarly assertive foreign policy. Sheinbaum has not shied away from courting Chinese and Russian investment in Mexico, both as a presidential candidate and as mayor, and has said Mexico should not have a “relationship of submission” with the U.S. A change in Mexico’s Constitution in 2021 under López Obrador that allows presidents to be removed from office halfway through their term by a national popular vote has also come under greater scrutiny lately. Critics warn that López Obrador could use this to control the direction of successive Morena governments, dangling the threat of removal and leveraging his popularity with Mexican voters if future presidents stray from his ideological vision. López Obrador and his supporters, including Sheinbaum, have defended the provision, saying it allows for greater democratic oversight of political leaders. Opposition parties are rallying together behind independent Senator Xóchitl Gálvez, who’s gunning to be Mexico’s first female Indigenous president. Gálvez’s supporters worry that another Morena presidency will set relations with the U.S. back, pointing to the various times López Obrador snubbed meeting Biden, and cause Mexico to experience further economic stagnation. They also criticize his public attacks against Gálvez and attempts to require elections for members of Mexico’s electoral commission. The transatlantic partner: U.K. U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak technically has until January 2025 to schedule an election, but he is likely to head to the ballot box earlier if opinion polls narrow or continued infighting within his ruling Conservative Party becomes unmanageable. While Sunak’s main rival is a moderate who has pledged to continue the U.K.’s support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia, a change in government could affect the U.K.'s approach toward the European Union after leaving the bloc in 2020, reshape the U.K.’s defense priorities and usher in changes to migration and foreign aid policies. The “special relationship” with the United States also could change drastically depending on who wins, potentially dooming or bolstering London’s efforts to press Washington for a major trade deal it hoped would help boost economic ties after Brexit. Personal affinity between British prime ministers and U.S. presidents has greatly impacted the relationship throughout history, something which will also depend on the winner of the U.S. election as well. The Tories, the largest party in the House of Commons since 2010, are facing significant public discontent over the economy, scandals related to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Covid-19 response and an ongoing crisis with the National Health Service. Divisions within the Tory ranks over migration and bad blood following the ouster of Johnson in 2022 have added to the party’s grim prospects. Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer is riding high with his group currently enjoying 43 percent support, according to POLITICO’s Poll of Polls, compared with the Tories at 25 percent — although questions remain about how much of this is driven by genuine enthusiasm for Labour rather than discontent with the Tories.

175587813,"New year to bring the coldest storm of the season so far, officials say","The first week of 2024 is expected to be a cold and wet one in Los Angeles, according to the National Weather Service. There's a 20% to 40% chance of rain into New Year's morning. People camping out for the Rose Parade may have seen some precipitation, but the parade itself should be mostly dry, said Rich Thompson of the weather service. That's good news for parade organizers, who were hoping the event — which begins at 8 a.m. at the corner of Green Street and Orange Grove Boulevard in Pasadena — will draw crowds nearly as large as those before the pandemic. Officials said last-minute tickets would be available Monday morning. “We feel good that the crowds will be strong again this year,"" Tournament of Roses Chief Executive David Eads told The Times last week. Highs on New Year's Day are expected to be in the upper 50s to mid-60s, officials said. The storm that officials are calling the coldest of the season so far is forecast to arrive later this week when a cold front sweeps down the coast, bringing light to moderate showers Wednesday and Thursday and some snowfall in the mountains. Rainfall is expected in much of Southern California with that storm, ranging from about half an inch to an inch, officials said. Highs are expected to be in the 50s midweek, which is cooler than normal for this time of year, weather service meteorologist David Gomberg told The Times. There's also a 20% chance of snow at elevations as low as 4,000 feet — which would affect the Grapevine — by late Wednesday, officials said. The region was also expected to continue to see high surf conditions throughout the week, and the wet weather could continue Saturday and Sunday, Thompson said. A high surf advisory was extended through Monday morning, though waves were not expected to be as high as they were last week, when beaches were pounded by massive swells, leading to injuries and beach closures.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-01-01/new-years-southern-california-weather-rain-snow,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67c396d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+174/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5a%2F25%2F2b01b7eb4d9ba3173d95b327f22b%2F1392097-me-high-surf,2024-01-01 13:00:03,Paloma Esquivel,['Paloma Esquivel'],en,us,-0.238
175567591,Peer support line for first responders and military looking for Alberta volunteers,"For decades, Karyn Carty and Peter Seigenthaler worked in the police services, dealing with some of the most difficult and traumatic cases. But now, they work directly with other first responders and military members who are looking to speak with colleagues who know exactly what they’re going through. Over the last five years, Boots on the Ground has been answering anonymous calls from those on the front lines of society’s most pressing issues. The organization launched its Alberta chapter in September and has already helped dozens of active and retired police officers, firefighters, medical professionals and military members. “If you want to talk, we’ll listen,” said Seigenthaler, a former Calgary police officer, duty sergeant and inspector. “If you want advice from our own lived experience, we’ll do that, but first and foremost we’re here to listen.” At any one time, there are three volunteers ready to answer the calls. No caller ID is shown and callers are never asked for their names, occupation or departments. “Everybody with Boots on the Ground is like-minded,” said Carty, a police communications expert and former 911 dispatcher. “It helps the people calling to know that we’re like-minded. I believe it’s helping.” During the holidays, the organization tends to see a rise in calls since first responders rarely get any sort of additional time off. “There’s always an expectation of an uptick in calls,” Carty said. “And from a peer support standpoint … they will utilize an organization like Boots on the Ground because they are suffering.” To try and help with the rise in demand, the organization is calling on more active and retired members of the community to step up and answer the calls from their colleagues. “There’s so much help needed,” Seigenthaler said. “First responders are struggling, and they often struggle in silence.” Interested volunteers can reach out through the Boots on the Ground website and if you need support, volunteers can be reached at 1-833-677-BOOT (2668).",https://globalnews.ca/news/10170239/peer-support-line-first-responders-military-alberta-volunteers/,https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/boots.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all,2024-01-01 13:00:06,Michael King,['Michael King'],en,ca,0.21

175567425,Sidhu Moosewala murder mastermind Goldy Brar declared a designated terrorist by Centre,"Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the brutal murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, was on Monday declared a designated terrorist by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). A key member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, Brar had claimed responsibility for the murder of Moosewala, who was killed in a hail of bullets in Punjab’s Mansa district on May 29, 2022. A native of Faridkot in Punjab, Brar, whose real name is Satinderjit Singh, went to Canada on a student visa in 2017. In a gazetted notification, Praveen Vashista, Additional Secretary, Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Additional Secretary, said, “And whereas, Satwinder Singh alias Satinderjit Singh alias Goldy Brar, presently residing in Brampton, Canada is associated with Babbar Khalsa International…And whereas, Babbar Khalsa International is listed as a terrorist organisation.” #JUSTIN: Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the brutal murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, declared a designated terrorist by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). @IndianExpress — Mahender Singh Manral (@mahendermanral) January 1, 2024 The notification said, “Goldy backed by a cross-border agency, was involved in multiple killings and professes radical ideology, figured in making threatening calls to pro-nationalist leaders, demanding ransom and posting the claims of killings on different social media platforms. He has been involved in smuggling of high-grade arms, ammunition and explosive materials through drones from across the border and supplying thereon for carrying out killings and also providing sharpshooters.” “Goldy and his associates have been conspiring to disrupt the peace, communal harmony and law and order in Punjab through nefarious designs including sabotage, the raising of terror modules, carrying out targeted killings, and other anti-national activities. A Red Corner Notice was issued against him by Interpol Secretariat General (IPSG), Lyon, France and a non-bailable warrant on December 12, 2022, was issued against him…A Look Out Circular was also on June 15, 2022,” it said. The notification added that the Central government believes that Goldy is involved in terrorism and he is to be added as a terrorist in the Fourth Schedule to the UAPA. While claiming responsibility for Mooosewala’s murder, Brar had said in a Facebook post, “Sachin Bishnoi Dhattaranwali, Lawrence Bishnoi, and I are behind the killing of Sidhu Moosewala.” The gangster had claimed that he killed Moosewala to avenge the death of Youth Akali Dal leader Vicky Middukhera. Brar had also claimed responsibility for the murder of Dera follower Pardeep Singh Kataria in Kotkapura in 2022. An accused in the 2015 Bargari sacrilege case, Kataria was out on bail and was shot dead at his shop by a group of six men on November 11 that year.

175574247,On the Historical Disunity of Ukrainians and Russians,"On the eve of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Vladimir Putin published his essay, “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.” In it he explains why he believes Russians and Ukrainians are “one people – a single whole.” Putin amplifies the idea that Ukraine should be and always was a part of Russia. Many in the West are indifferent to Russia’s invasion, some even go as far as to say: “Why should we care about a boundary dispute?” Contrary to Putin’s statement, Ukraine is fundamentally different than Russia. It is important to restate the central principle which divides Ukraine and Russia: their systems of government. Yes, Ukrainians and Russians have a common predecessor in Kyivan-Rus dating back 1,000 years. But just as families can grow apart and seek different paths, Ukrainians and Russians have grown apart over the centuries. They have adopted fundamentally different views of the relationship between the individual and the state. The history is long and complex, but a concise background for the reader is in order. Where the histories split Ukraine and Russia trace their histories back 1,000 years to Kyivan-Rus (or simply Rus). The collection of principalities known as Rus had its capital in the city of Kyiv. Rus lands occupied the river systems between the White Sea near Finland and the Black Sea, part of a flourishing trade route that linked the Scandinavians and Byzantine Empire. Out of the many Rus principalities, two of them are most relevant for this discussion. The first is Vladimir-Suzdal in the northeast of Rus, which later became part of Muscovy with its capital Moscow. The second is the principality of Galicia-Volhynia in the far west of Rus, which later became part of present-day Ukraine. In the 13th century, Galicia-Volhynia was ruled by Prince Danylo and his sons. Rus prospered for around 400 years. Among the Rus princes, the Grand Prince of Kyiv was viewed as first among equals, not an absolute ruler, with frequent infighting among the princes for status and power. With its loose political structure and lack of coherence, Rus was vulnerable to an organized military society like the Mongols. The Mongol Empire, ruled first by Genghis Khan, and then by his sons, was the largest land empire the world has ever known. It stretched across Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to present day Poland. The Mongols first entered Eastern Europe around 1223, after having first conquered much of China, and the great nations of Central Asia. During this time even great centralized powers like Persia fell to the Mongols. The loose structure of Rus could not resist the Mongol war machine. In the end, the Mongols conquered almost all of Rus. Grand Prince Yuri II of Vladimir-Suzdal was killed in 1238 at the Battle of Sit River and the capital Kyiv was razed to the ground in December of 1240. Regarding the Mongol invasions, Putin glosses over the topic in his essay, “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.” Offering a cursory history he states: “The northeastern part of Rus fell under the control of the [Mongols] but retained limited sovereignty. The southern and western Russian lands largely became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which – most significantly – was referred to in historical records as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Russia.” Putin is correct that Vladimir-Suzdal and Galicia-Volhynia had differing experiences during and after the Mongol invasions. As Putin describes above, Vladimir-Suzdal, with its lands in the northeast, was under direct vassalage of the Mongol invaders, and retained little sovereignty. The cities in Vladimir-Suzdal began to prosper under the control of the Mongols due to access to trade routes to Asia, like the Silk Road. A great exchange of culture, ideas, and goods occurred. Putin’s crucial lacuna: contact with the seeds of democracy Putin leaves out a crucial bit about the western Rus lands of Galicia-Volhynia. He states a half-truth. Western Rus lands became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ruthenia, not “Russia.” Further, Putin ignores the fact that western Rus lands in Galicia-Volhynia retained sovereignty for well over 100 years under Prince Danylo and his successors until 1340. Danylo’s lands prospered, and even grew, and did not experience the type of vassalage the Mongols were exerting over Vladimir-Suzdal. In his essay, Vladimir Putin leaves out any mention of Danylo, who is a crucial figure in understanding Ukraine. Unlike Vladimir-Suzdal, which had greater ties with Asia due to Mongol vassalage, Galicia-Volhynia was now becoming a part of Europe under Danylo. Danylo’s rule was characterized by his political maneuvering to appease Mongol generals. He met with Mongol generals on numerous occasions, accepting them as “rulers” in principle. Danylo established ties with Hungary and Poland during these times. This was all done with the intention of deterring the Mongols and expanding and strengthening Galicia-Volhynia. Danylo appealed to the Pope Innocent IV in Rome to send a crusade to help him expel the Mongols. Although the Pope did not send troops, the Pope granted Danylo the title, King of Ruthenia. Ruthenian being the Latin term for “people of Rus.” Ukrainians, before calling themselves Ukrainians, called themselves Ruthenians well into the 20th century. Danylo’s son Lev further expanded the territories of Galicia-Volhynia. He facilitated the growth of Lviv, the major city in the region, named after Lev himself. Lev’s son Andrew continued his grandfather Danylo’s work, keeping firm European relations with the Poles and the 14th century German states. Eventually, Galicia-Volhynia was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Poland and Ruthenia. The people of Galicia-Volhynia, again called Ruthenians in the sources, retained control over their language and culture, and thus the foundations were laid for the Ukrainian identity, one that was European, and exposed to major European movements like the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Humanism. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ruthenia, as well as its successor, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, were characterized by a decentralized government where every noble member of the Parliament, or “Sejm,” could veto legislation. The Sejm, which included many Ruthenian members, exposed Ukrainians to the benefits and problems of democracy. (Above: Portrait of a Ruthenian woman at the Ellis Island Immigration Station, 1906. Photo colorization by Sanna Dullaway for TIME / original image: The New York Public Library) After the decline and fall of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, between 1772 and 1795 western Ukrainian lands were absorbed into the central European Hapsburg Empire (later Austro-Hungary), ushering in a period when Lviv and Milan were part of the same state. Austro-Hungary became a constitutional monarchy in 1867, and Ruthenians elected members to the legislature. Again, Ukrainian lands were part of a democratic, European state. As Europe experienced the Enlightenment, Ukrainians grew along with it. Beyond Ukrainian inclusion into Central European governments, a second foundation for freedom arose. In the south, during the 16th century, Ukraine was protected by the freedom-loving Cossacks, who elected their own leaders, and would fight anyone who tried to place limits on their freedom. The famed historian of Russia Mykola Kostomarov said of Ukraine that its “Cossack origins had made it democratic and egalitarian… they had no tsars… they had no nobility.” Moscow stuck in a Mongol mindset By contrast, Vladimir-Suzdal, and later Muscovy, was still firmly under Mongol rule until the late 15th century. By this time, Muscovite culture was heavily influenced by the Mongols – much of the nobility was of Mongol descent. However, the Mongol rule over Muscovy began to collapse with the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. The Battle on the Ugra River in 1480 marked the end of Mongol rule over Russian lands. The Grand Prince of Muscovy took the title of Tsar of all Rus. And Muscovy, only began to be called “Russia” in 1547. Muscovy and its tsars viewed strength as the primary virtue needed to expel the Mongols and protect the viability of the state. As a result, Muscovy had a view of the state that led to its constant expansion and absorption of surrounding areas for centuries. The individual was subordinated to the needs of the state, and the tsar the absolute autocrat. This was a powerful and successful model in world affairs during that violent era. It led to the defeat of the Mongols and the ever-expanding Russian Empire in successive centuries, to the point where the Russian Empire became, as Russia remains today, the largest country in the world. Today’s Russia and Vladimir Putin are the heirs of this theory of the absolute dominance of the state over the individual and the need for an autocrat to rule with an iron fist and conquer new lands. Putin has adopted all the old imperial symbols, like the double headed eagle; and his ceremonial guards wear 19th-century imperial uniforms. Today many Russians are deeply aware of their history, and support Putin in his war against Ukraine. In fact, many Russians still have favorable views of Stalin despite his horrific cruelties. Russia’s absolute disregard for its battlefield casualties both in World War II and during this current war with Ukraine is an example of the consequences of such a system. This history makes clear: Ukraine was long a part of Europe, rather than Putin’s “Russian world.” When the 13th century Mongol invasions destroyed Rus, Galicia-Volhynia and Vladimir-Suzdal were split. This split initiated the divergence of the Ukrainian and Russian identities and styles of government. Today’s European trajectory The history explains why today Ukrainians are a European and democratic people who favor freedom and democracy. It explains why Ukrainians fought many battles against the ever-expanding Russian Empire, including under Petro Sahaidachny in the Polish-Muscovite War of 1605 in alliance with Poland or under Ivan Mazepa in the great Northern War of 1700-1722 in alliance with Sweden. Even the horrific Holodomor in 1932-33, when Stalin created an artificial famine and killed countless millions to break the will of the Ukrainian peasant farmers who refused to give up their land, shows the persistent freedom-loving nature of Ukrainians. (Above: Ukrainian Hetman Petro Sahaidachny at the 1621 Battle of Khotyn where he was mortally wounded. Credit: Andrey Serebryakov). Now, Ukraine is fighting for its survival against a great autocracy that denies Ukraine’s very existence. But more than just a struggle of a free people against a large and powerful neighbor, this is a struggle to define the relationship between a people and its state. Is Putin’s Russia the model we want to be victorious? Is the state supreme above all other concerns, including the rights of the individual? Or is Ukraine to survive? Do the Western ideals of freedom and democracy matter? The answers to these questions have global implications. Is the future of mankind in an era of ever more powerful Artificial Intelligence one of constant surveillance to achieve the total subordination of the individual to the state? This prospect is far more frightening than George Orwell imagined in 1984. Or do individual humans and human rights matter? Is our collective future full of light and liberty? In every nation’s history, there comes a time when it must earn its freedom.

175612617,"&#039;We need more truth and love, as pathetic as that sounds&#039;: President Čaputová&#039;s New Year&#039;s address","Dear Fellow Citizens, I wish you a lot of health, comfort and understanding on the threshold of the new year. Today we commemorate the 31st anniversary of our statehood. I wish for 2024 to bring more peace and stability. Our private wishes and expectations for the coming year may differ. But at this moment, almost all of us maintain the hope that they will be fulfilled. That even if complications and difficulties arise, we will manage to solve them and things will get better. However, in the difficult times we have been living in the last few years, even our hope is often confronted by harsh reality. We experienced too many crises, a source of uncertainty and which placed many in difficult life situations. The past year was no exception. We have experienced numerous political conflicts, three prime ministers, a fierce election campaign and early elections. It was undoubtedly a challenging year, full of changes, expectations, their fulfilment, but also disappointments. Early elections probably resulted in the biggest change. A change of government is also a part of democracy. However, elections do not change society, the democratic values ​​on which it is based must not be changed. And if there is an effort towards fundamental changes, then it can happen only after a thorough analysis and honest discussion. Thus, we need a continuity of values when building our statehood. Not just declared, but real. Therefore, let's protect and promote our constitutional democratic values. Let's also protect the institutions whose functioning is necessary for democracy. Whether it is law enforcement agencies, free media, or non-governmental organisations. Let's continue to do so with respect and decency. So that the desire to fight does not darken anyone's mind, and so that fighting itself does not become the main meaning of our actions instead of the values ​​we wanted to protect. Building and strengthening statehood is our common duty. We may not be able to eliminate all its shortcomings and diseases right away. But that cannot be a reason to resign ourselves. We are not responsible for the outcome, but we are fully responsible for our part in it. Dear Fellow Citizens, It would be disrespectful to the truth if we told ourselves that there is no reason to disagree and be dissatisfied with some phenomena in our society. The lists are long. But let's also talk about what we can be proud of and what we can rely on in our society. The reason for pride is certainly you, our citizens, our civil society, which has been showing its maturity and solidarity for years. Active citizens and non-governmental organisations have long fulfilled important functions in the fields of social care, education, environmental protection, and in the promotion of the rights of minorities and all people without difference. We can also rely on our local governments, which once again confirmed their viability and professionalism, and were a stabilising element of the functioning of our state in changing times. The result of your work is a concrete help, sometimes even leading to systemic changes. But it always helps us trust ourselves and trust each other a little more. Dear Fellow Citizens, Help is the basis of trust, and trust is a prerequisite for a functioning state and a cohesive community. Therefore, the primary role of the state in crisis situations must be direct assistance to those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves on the verge of survival. For a long time, poverty has not only affected people who have lost their jobs, but also working people and entire families who live without savings and in conditions that threaten their dignity. Today, incomplete, single-parent families and especially children are most at risk. At the same time, we owe the most to children and the young generation. Even experts warn us that there is a gap between us and the younger generation. According to many studies, young people feel misunderstood and lonely. We observe alarming cases of bullying, young people increasingly seeking the help of psychologists and psychiatrists, and it is no longer unusual for them to take their own lives. So we must be significantly more interested in what young people are experiencing. We need to create a safe school environment for them, leave a functioning pension system, sustainable public finances and not abandon them in uncertainty in solving the climate crisis. Our mistakes, our inattention and irresponsibility will be felt more fundamentally by the generation of today's youth than by their parents. We must be anchored in the present, but we must not forget that this does not absolve us of responsibility for the future. Dear Fellow Citizens, As president, I am addressing you for the last time at this New Year's moment. When I took up the post of president, I said that if we are to successfully manage the journey from a Slovakia as it stands now to a Slovakia as it could be, we must openly talk about what helps us and what holds us back. Five years after I took office, I am convinced that one of the biggest obstacles to our development is a lack of culture, especially in politics, and the number of conflicts in our society. For many, it is also an obstacle to staying in Slovakia, and for others an obstacle to returning home. Animosity becomes a hallmark of public life. However, it also spills over into our families, households, and relationships between people. Rudeness, vulgarity and lying are not signs of strength, but of weakness. Weak people resort to them. They are impressed by such behaviour and so they repeat it. True strength lies in calmness and perspective. And the greatest strength is the ability to control yourself. It is not by chance that one attribute of democracy is the ability to exchange opinions and communicate decently, to respect other people even with different views. These characteristics and qualities proved to be a necessary prerequisite for people to coexist and form a functioning society. They are standards created over years of development. We simply need more truth and love, as pathetic as that sounds. Finally, remembering the values ​​and qualities proven over centuries does not have to be pathetic. That they are notorious is not a sign of their devaluation, but on the contrary, it confirms their validity and importance. And we still need them now. We all need more kindness and understanding in communication, in interactions, even when we disagree. Actually, especially then. Because there is always a person standing opposite us, because we all belong to the same human family. People must not feel threatened. They must feel a sense of security and belonging to their community, to their surroundings, so that they can combine their skills and strengths. Dear Fellow Citizens, Despite the difficult years we have experienced, we need to look to the future with hope. During the almost five years of my mandate, I met thousands of people, our citizens. They were exceptional stories, great talents, successful companies, excellent scientists, people in factories, villages, and cities. And every time the Slovak national anthem was played during a foreign visit, this experience was also there with me. I was there with these innumerable reasons to be proud of Slovakia. Of the country under the Tatras, which still has a long way to go, but which has already covered part of a successful path. I wish you a happy and successful new year!",https://spectator.sme.sk/c/23262916/president-zuzana-caputova-new-years-address-2024.html,https://m.smedata.sk/api-media/media/image/spectator/8/86/8656428/8656428_1200x800.png?rev=3,2024-01-01 13:09:00,"Iryna Uias, Zuzana Čaputová","['Iryna Uias', 'Zuzana Čaputová']",en,sk,-0.144

175569695,2024: Ogun monarch sets agenda for Tinubu,"A respected monarch, Onibudo of Ayetoro Budo-Ota in Ado-Odo Ota local government area of Ogun State, Oba Adewunmi Odutala, has advised the federal government to pay more attention to locally made goods in the year 2024. The monarch said if Nigeria must achieve prosperity, goods that Nigerians produce must stop coming from foreign countries into NigeriaN local markets. Oba Odutala said this at a special press briefing organised to advise the Nigerian government for the year 2024. In his words, he said, “Government should pay attention to little things that affect the lives of the common masses. We should encourage locally-made goods in 2024. Invest in local manufacturers. The FG should stop the importation of Ankara fabrics and empower Ankara factories in Nigeria. “If they want Nigerians to patronise the local market, the government should settle down and invest in local markets and we will all thrive together.” The monarch also appealed to the federal government to nip in the bud, the gradual death of Nigeria’s local languages. Just like English and mathematics, Oba Odutala advocated that the government should ensure that candidates excel in their local languages to get admitted into tertiary institutions in the country. “Encourage the speaking of local languages in government offices and schools, make local languages a compulsory subject to gain admission into our higher institutions. It is only in Nigeria we train our children with foreign languages and we want them to do well academically, it doesn't work that way, you can't use another man's language to train your children and expect them to excel. The level of intelligence is not determined by how much vocabulary they can speak. “Nations that teach their children local languages are better than us. What have we invented or gained from speaking big English? 2024 must change.” In the same vein, the monarch also urged President Bola Tinubu to work on repairing “the battered government image” to achieve citizens' trust. Oba Odutala noted that President Tinubu should ensure political officeholders fulfil their campaign promises to the people, insisting that, “Any business transacted with the absence of trust will not end well. “Government must fulfil all the promises they made. State and local governments should be ready to be accountable to the people in 2024 because we know the amount of allocation they get from the federal government. The state and local governments should think about the masses and stop blaming the federal government for their failures. They should implement social welfare for their people and stop pushing all the blame on Tinubu.”",https://dailypost.ng/2024/01/01/2024-ogun-monarch-sets-agenda-for-tinubu/,https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/President-Bola-Ahmed-Tinubu-1.jpg,2024-01-01 13:12:55,Olasunkanmi Akinlotan,['Olasunkanmi Akinlotan'],en,ng,0.071
175568335,"Trump faces $250M penalty, ban from doing business in NY when judge issues verdict this month","The new year could be off to a rough start for Donald Trump. The former president is facing $250 million in penalties and a ban on doing business in New York when the judge overseeing his civil fraud trial delivers a verdict in the case later in January. The Manhattan Supreme Court trial — which has been on hiatus since Dec. 13 — is set to resume with closing arguments on Jan. 11, and Justice Arthur Engoron has said he hopes to have a decision in the non-jury case by the end of the month. New York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking at least $250 million in repayment of alleged ill-gotten gains from Trump, 77, and his co-defendants, including his two eldest sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. The Republican 2024 presidential frontrunner is accused of exaggerating the value of his assets by billions on yearly financial statements to get better loan and insurance terms. Engoron has already found that Trump is liable for fraud, but other claims in James’ lawsuit, as well as a potential final penalty, still need to be ruled on. The judge could order Trump to pay less — or more — than what the AG is seeking, but one legal expert said it was more likely he will either rule that the ex-president owes the full $250 million, or nothing. “There has been no clear number of either ill-gotten gain or loss, so I don’t know how the judge would come up with a different number,” Evan Gotlob, a former prosecutor and white collar defense attorney, told The Post. The court has heard from some 40 witnesses since the trial started on Oct. 2, but not a lot of the testimony focused on how much each lender or insurer lost due to Trump’s alleged fraud — making it unlikely that Engoron would come up with a different number than the sum James is seeking. “I doubt the judge in this case would go above the amount because they have no basis to unless they have a forensic accountant going through an enormous organization like the Trump Organization, all their books and all the improper benefits they got,” Gotlob said. It’s also unlikely the judge would set the penalty lower than $250 million, he said. “I think it’s going to be very difficult, unless one of the judge’s clerks is a secret finance expert, to come up with a number that’s significantly lower — based on what? The evidence hasn’t really gone either way, so that there is $250 million or not,” Gotlob said. And he said judges tend to try to make financial penalties payable. “When you’re a judge you find out what they can pay whether — it’s through bankruptcy or not,” Gotlob said. “I think the Trump organization is worth between $1 billion and $3 billion… there is money to pay.” Engoron in a bombshell ruling from just before the start of trial found that Trump was liable on one of the AG’s main fraud claims and the judge revoked the Trump Organization’s business licenses. The company can continue to do business as the latter part of the decision was put on hold by an appeals court at least until Engoron issues his verdict. But even after the verdict is issued, Gotlob predicted it would be years until the case concludes as Trump is likely to appeal any negative ruling all the way to the Empire State’s top court. “This is a case that I could see, especially knowing how much the former president loves fighting decisions against him, that it’s going to go all the way up to the Court of Appeals,” Gotlob said. The earliest the case would be resolved is after the 2024 presidential election, since “courts don’t like to get involved in politics,” Gotlob suggested, adding that a final ruling could come down as late as 2025 or 2026. As for the business licenses getting revoked, Gotlob said he thinks it’ll be years before the Trump real estate empire feels the effects due to the pause of the ruling, pending appeals. Even if the ruling takes effect, Trump could find ways around it — for instance by running shell companies, the lawyer opined. Still, “the possibility to lose business licenses for, at a minimum of five or even more years, that’s pretty damaging,” Gotlob said. “New York is like the epicenter of the business world.” The real estate tycoon is a defendant alongside his two eldest sons, the Trump Org and others in the case accusing Trump of pumping up the value of his assets on annual statements of financial condition from 2011 through 2021. Testimony at the trial lasted for 11 weeks and featured the former commander-in-chief, kids Eric, 39, Ivanka, 42, and Donald Jr., 45, all taking the witness stand. The former first daughter was also initially a defendant on the case until an appeals court dismissed her finding the claims against her were outside the statute of limitations. All four Trumps denied the AG’s claims and blamed any discrepancies on the financial documents on accountants and lawyers. Trump was in court for eight days of the trial — which he was not required to attend like he would be in a criminal case — and repeatedly attacked the AG and the case, as well as the judge and even Engoron’s top law clerk. Engoron issued a limited gag order on the second day of trial barring Trump from publicly speaking about his court staff when the 45th president went after the judge’s chief clerk Allison Greenfield on social media. The judge has fined Trump for $15,000 finding he twice violated the gag order.",https://nypost.com/2024/01/01/news/trump-faces-250m-penalty-business-ban-in-ny-upon-verdict/,https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/newspress-collage-0a0j94m4s-1702670777014.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1702654026&w=1200,2024-01-01 13:15:54,Priscilla DeGregory,['Priscilla DeGregory'],en,us,-0.602
175582213,Founder of Fermanagh distillery says demand for Irish spirits has ‘exploded’,"The founder of Fermanagh’s first legal gin distillery in more than 100 years, which is now exporting to over 15 countries, said there has been an “explosion” in global demand for Irish spirits. The Boatyard Distillery, situated on the banks of Lough Erne, is Fermanagh’s first legal distillery since 1890. The distillery, specialising in gin, was founded by Joe McGirr who grew up on a farm near the current site. Mr McGirr said he “fell in love” with the gin-making process while working in Edinburgh and fought hard to create a distillery in his home town.

You can arrive by boat, or by car, right to the distillery door, and I don’t know of any other distillery in Scotland or elsewhere, where you can actually do that, sort of right to the door. “So the place is very unique and very special, and you just can’t recreate that anywhere else.” Mr McGirr said the distillery utilises local produce to create a flavour profile distinct to Northern Ireland. “We set about trying to source organic based product, and we’re using organic wheat from a farmer in Monaghan and he grows us wheat, which sounds like a normal crop, but the amount of love that he’s got. And it’s in Monaghan so not that far from us,” he said. “He grows his wheat on north-facing hills, they’re actually hard to harvest so they’re quite steeply sloped. That gives lots of drainage. “It’s organic farming, so it’s a very much ‘shut the gate and see what happens’, no fertilisers or any separate chemicals going on there.” He added: “What are the key base products for our spirits are really important and that follows through, it wouldn’t be the same if we couldn’t get that. Being less than an hour away is really important for us.” Mr McGirr said despite the influx of bespoke products to the whiskey and gin markets, the character of Irish spirits is unique to the market. “I think there is an explosion in Ireland, both sides of the border at the minute towards Irish spirits, and how good they can be and that diversity that we’ve got at the minute in Irish spirits is incredible,” he said. “And you add into that the we’ve got this amazing thing called the distillery trail in Northern Ireland, which you can come and visit lots and lots of different distilleries, and you’d get a little card, we call it a passport, where you get stamped and that encourages people to kind of move around them and get different experiences, meet different people. “It is about the people, I think with all of the distilleries in a world where there’s a lot of whiskey and gin distilleries but each one is individually different. They look and feel different. And the people are very different and I think that’s the takeaway. Collectively I feel like we’ve got something very special to bring to the world.” The global popularity of Irish spirits have seen the Fermanagh distilled gin increase in popularity across the world. “We do really well, and this one amazes me every time, in Seoul in South Korea,” Mr McGirr said. “So we’ve got a lot of bars, like four seasons, we’ve got some amazing bars over there, and they love it. And when you see it being poured over there, and the passion that they’ve got, like they own it, that is just amazing. “I haven’t been lucky enough to get to go there for a martini, yet, touch wood, but that day is coming. “We’ve been in New York quite a few times and that’s always amazing when you see, and maybe it’s an ego thing as well, when you walk into a bar in New York, and someone orders a Boatyard next to you and you’re like, this is amazing.” The Boatyard distillery is the only distillery on the island of Ireland to be B Corp certified, a certification that measures accountability, transparency and sustainability.

175568869,Air safety 2023: Accidents and fatalities at record low,"Commercial aviation was safer in 2023 than in any previous year. According to a leading air safety expert, last year set a new record for the fewest accidents and deaths. Only two fatal accidents occurred during the 12 months, compared with six in 2022. In both crashes, propeller aircraft came down on domestic flights, with a total of 86 deaths – fewer than half the 178 fatalities in 2023. For comparison, 148 people die in the average hour on the world’s roads according to the latest UN figures. No fatal aircraft accidents involved international flights or passenger jets. In a civil aviation safety review for the Dutch air-safety organisation To70, senior aviation consultant Adrian Young writes: “Both the number of accidents and fatalities are at a record low.” The fatal accident rate was less than one in 15 million flights – three times better than the 10-year average. The first and deadliest crash was in Nepal on 15 January 2023. An ATR-72 belonging to Yeti Airlines took off and flew normally from Kathmandu to Pokhara, but plunged into a gorge one mile short of the runway. The subsequent investigation found that high workload and stress on the flight deck was responsible. Mr Young says the accident report revealed the pilots’ actions resulted in “the feathering of both propellers and subsequent loss of thrust, leading to an aerodynamic stall”. The second fatal accident was in Brazil on 16 September 2023, when an Embraer 110 belonging to Manaus Airlines crashed on a flight from the Amazonian city to Barcelos during bad weather. All 14 passengers and crew died. The safety of jet aircraft repeats the unlikely success of 2017, according to Mr Young. “As the new year dawns and we look back across 2023, civil aviation finds itself in a similar position to 2017 with no fatal accidents to large turbofan powered, passenger aeroplanes in commercial service,” he writes. This category encompasses everything from commuter jets of the type used at London City airport to the Airbus A380 “SuperJumbo”. The notorious crash of a private jet carrying the boss of Russia’s Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is excluded. The plane crashed with the loss of all 10 on board on 23 August 2023 during a flight from Moscow to St Petersburg. Reports claim an ally of Vladimir Putin was responsible for placing a bomb on the Embraer 135 aircraft. International law requires countries to involve the nation where the plane was made, in this case Brazil. But Russia refused to involve the Brazilian authorities or the aircraft manufacturer in the investigation. Mr Young describes this as “an unwelcome step that goes against the collaborative nature of accident investigation and does not help with the main reason to investigate accidents; the learning of lessons”. The safety expert warns of “a number of incidents and non-fatal accidents that require the industry to remain vigilant”. He writes: “Regardless of how low the accident rate in 2023 has been, there is no cause for complacency. “Aviation remains a risk-laden industry and as airports around the world report that movements are reaching the same level as in 2019, before the Covid 19 crisis, a number of issues have not gone away. “Serious injuries due to turbulence remain an ever-present factor in the year’s accidents.” Eleven passengers aboard a charter flight from Barbados to Manchester were hurt when their Airbus A330 encountered clear air turbulence over the Atlantic. The plane diverted to Bermuda on Christmas Eve. This year will see the 10th anniversary of the two tragedies involving Boeing 777 aircraft belonging to Malaysia Airlines. On 8 March 2014, flight MH370 disappeared while on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The jet is presumed to have come down in the Indian Ocean west of Australia. No trace has been found of the 227 passengers and 12 crew. On 17 July 2014, flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was downed by a Russian missile fired from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine. All 298 passengers and crew perished.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/air-safety-accidents-record-low-2023-b2471757.html,https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/01/17/07/newFile.jpg?width=1200,2024-01-01 13:19:39,Simon Calder,['Simon Calder'],en,gb,-0.311

175570251,Scots mental health experts share important New Year advice to help people struggling with low mood,"The hustle and bustle of Christmas is over and we're about to enter a brand new year, which can be a really exciting thing for a lot of people. But for many, the mental health slump that often happens after the holidays can leave you feeling helpless and wondering how to improve your wellbeing in the New Year. This dip in mood can be down to a number of different reasons - for example, a crash in energy after the excitement of the festive period. Whether you celebrated Christmas or not, spent the day working, with loved ones, or alone, anyone can feel down during this time of year. That’s why it’s more important than ever to make some time for self-care to try to protect our mental health. With this in mind, mental health experts at Scottish Action for Mental Health (SAMH) have put together a list of five things that you can do if you ever feel down. Connect with loved ones It can be easy to assume that everyone is busy seeing friends and family over this time, but if you’re feeling a bit lonely, it’s unlikely you’re the only one. To combat this, reach out to friends and suggest meeting up or having a chat over the phone. Technology can be a great asset here – there are lots of online games or activities you can do with others, even if they aren’t nearby. Or if you prefer the traditional approach, you can even write to someone who you haven't been in touch with for a while. Be active This one can be tough at this time of year, especially due to the unpredictable weather. But if you can, getting out for some fresh air and a walk really can do wonders for our mental health. And if not, you can try some yoga or gentle stretching indoors. There are plenty of options to give you ideas for a simple home workout on YouTube. Even a bit of light housework can get you moving and make you feel good about yourself. Take notice Slowing down and taking time to appreciate the small things is so important. As we come to end of the year, why not make a list of your favourite moments from the past 12 months, or reflect on what you’ve achieved? It doesn’t need to be anything big - maybe you’ve taken a step towards achieving a goal, or finally done something you had been putting off. When you’re out of the house, try to check in with all of your senses, one at a time, making a mental note of what can you see, smell, taste, touch, and hear. Meditation can also be a useful way to stop and mindfully take notice of how your body feels. Learn something new You’re never too old to learn something new, and there are lots of options that allow you to do this from the comfort of your sofa. Check out an interesting documentary you’ve been meaning to watch, or learn a new craft, like knitting or origami. You can also use this time to set a learning intention for the year by signing up to a new class or researching something you would like to learn next year. As well as this, there’s plenty of free learning opportunities out there that you can kickstart straight away. Give something back Giving feels good, and sometimes it can give us that all important little boost that we need. If you find yourself with some extra time at this time of year, consider volunteering in your local community There are lots of ways you can help out, and some of these can be done online if that suits you better. You can check out Volunteer Scotland for more options. You could also have a clear-out of things you don’t need any more and give them in to charity, or do a favour for a neighbour or friend. While the five ways to better wellbeing can be a helpful for some, if you find that you’re really struggling over this period, do reach out for help.

175576493,"More Big Companies Set to Collapse in 2024, Industry Experts Warn","More big firms are likely to go bust next year amid the “double whammy” of high borrowing costs and pressure on consumer budgets, according to insolvency experts. Administrators and restructuring specialists also warned the PA news agency that high-growth companies such as tech firms could be among those facing financial turbulence. It comes after another year of tough economic conditions resulted in increased business failures during the year. Official figures from the Insolvency Service earlier this month showed the total of company failures over the first 11 months of 2023 was more than reported during the entirety of 2022. PwC’s head of insolvency David Kelly said both the construction sector and business services industries each saw almost a fifth of total insolvencies. He said he therefore expects these areas to “remain the hardest hit in 2024.” Hospitality and retail have also contributed to business failures as they have been impacted by higher energy prices, pressure on consumer finances and borrowing costs. Around 17 percent of all insolvencies have come from the hospitality sector and 14 percent have come from retailers. This included high-profile failures such as the administration of Wilko, which had operated 400 shops and employed more than 12,000 workers. Paperchase, Planet Organic and Le Pain Quotidien were also among those to enter insolvency during 2023. Rob Hornby, partner and managing director of AlixPartners, said he expects company insolvencies to continue apace in 2024. “We are expecting next year to be a big year for insolvency,” he said. “That is likely to be across the board, both in terms of geographies and sectors.” The director at the restructuring and advisory specialist said typically high-growth areas, such as technology, could see turbulence as financing comes under increased pressure. Mr. Hornby said: “I personally think we are definitely seeing an element of the dotcom bubble repeating itself. “Since before the pandemic, there was plenty of investment money around, with VCs (venture capitals) worried about missing out. “You ended up with some areas of tech, for example, where you had more competitors funded in one space than were ever likely to succeed sustainably in the longer term. “Now some of that funding is running dry, you will start to see consequences.” Mr. Hornby and Richard Fleming, managing director and head of restructuring for Europe, at Alvarez & Marsal, both said they expected more firms to use restructuring plans this year in an effort to avoid full administrations. Nevertheless, Mr. Fleming said there was potential for some large failures next year as those with large debt burdens face particular pressure due high-interest rates. “We are expecting a similar level of insolvencies overall in 2024, but we should see an increased number of larger cases,” he said. “The impact of higher interest rates will increasingly be felt by companies who need to service their debt and by households on their mortgage payments. “Therefore, we’re expecting a double-whammy impact on companies across the UK, with a slowdown in consumer demand and higher borrowing costs, all putting stress on margins.”",https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/more-big-companies-set-to-collapse-in-2024-industry-experts-warn-5556262,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/10/17/id5511701-GettyImages-1310127935-300x180.jpg,2024-01-01 13:21:20,PA Media,['PA Media'],en,us,-0.255
175569859,Guinea junta plans referendum for new constitution,"The head of Guinea’s ruling junta says a constitutional referendum will be held in 2024, a key step towards the return of civilian rule after seizing power in a coup. Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, who has ruled since overthrowing the country’s first democratically elected president in 2021, announced the vote during an end-of-year speech late Sunday. He gave no date for the referendum. “In the new year, a new constitution which resembles us and brings us together will be submitted to a referendum,” Doumbouya said. He promised a constitution “approved by the people and which is not a copy and paste but a constitution, which draws inspiration from the past to together build our future”. Doumbouya also said that people appointed by the state will soon be named to lead municipal councils, which were elected in 2018 and whose mandates end in the first few months of the year. Nearly all the councils are currently headed by officials from parties of the ousted civilian ex-president Alpha Conde or former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo which are critical of the military leadership. Doumbouya said the announcements were due to a wish to “continue the considerable efforts to return to constitutional order through the organisation of free, democratic and transparent elections” respecting the timetable for a transition back to civilian rule. Conde took office in 2010 after decades of authoritarian rule. But he came under increasing fire after pushing through a constitutional reform that critics had argued was designed to allow him to run for a third term. After taking power, Doumbouya, under international pressure, promised to hand the reins of government back to elected civilians by January 2026. The September 2021 coup is among a string of putscheas and attempted coups in West Africa since 2020.

175572793,Medical teams in Gaza Strip exhausted dealing with large numbers of patients&#039; injuries: Doctor,"A British doctor of Palestinian origin said medical teams in the Gaza Strip are exhausted, dealing with large numbers of patients, Anadolu Agency reports. “The medical staff (at the European Gaza Hospital in the city of Khan Younis) is very exhausted, and the emergency department always receives patients with difficult and complex cases,” Basil Badir, an orthopaedic specialist from the team IDEALS, affiliated with the Islamic Aid charity organisation in the UK, told Anadolu in an exclusive interview. Badir, who arrived in the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on 25 December with four doctors, stressed that health teams in Gaza are exhausted, especially those working in hospital emergency departments. He said the role of the British medical team is to “try to alleviate the suffering of their colleagues working in the medical field in Gaza, even if only in a small way.” Describing doctors in the Gaza Strip as “real heroes,” Badir noted that patients transferred from the northern Gaza Strip to its southern part due to incomplete treatments face difficult health complications. “Before the hospitals in the north of Gaza were closed, many patients who had received partial treatment were forcibly sent to the southern part. These individuals are experiencing serious health problems due to the incomplete treatment,” he added. READ: 150 Palestinians killed, 286 injured as Israeli forces continue onslaught on Gaza: Health Ministry Emphasizing the challenging health situation at the European Gaza Hospital, where there are at least 900 patients and injured people, Badir said this number is twice the normal capacity during regular times. He said his accompanying health team has been visiting the Gaza Strip periodically for about 13 years, around eight to nine times a year, focusing on surgical areas. Last Sunday, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the destruction of the health system in the Gaza Strip as a “tragedy” on X. At least 150 Palestinians were killed and another 286 wounded in the past 24 hours as Israeli forces continued their onslaught in the besieged Gaza Strip, the Health Ministry in the blockaded enclave said Sunday. The Palestinian death toll from the Israeli army’s ongoing attacks on Gaza since 7 October has risen to 21,822, with 56,451 wounded, the ministry said.

175571475,Urgent plans to stop homeless people being separated from pets over fears for mental health,"Urgent moves are being made to stop people who are made homeless being forcibly separated from their pets. The explosion in Scottish homelessness has meant a generation of people in temporary homes and hotels - most of which forbid cats. dogs and other pets. The removal of animals from people in crisis has caused a parallel risk of mental health breakdown in highly vulnerable people. And some have chosen to sleep on streets rather than lose their pets. The Scottish SPCA charity has now formed an alliance with homelessness counterparts at the Simon Community, with both seeking to work with landlords to open pathways for pet owners to stay with cats, dogs and other pets. Scottish SPCA chief executive Kirsteen Campbell said, “Our research shows that 37% of tenants surveyed had to make the impossible choice between a roof over their head and a beloved pet. It’s a choice nobody should have to make.” “We want to work together and intervene early, to keep pets and people together in a home and not see them end up on the streets."" She added: “Our two frontline teams will share knowledge and resources so we can spot the signs when someone is at risk of becoming homeless or identify someone who has pets and is struggling. “This will allow us to get ahead of the problem before an animal, or person, suffers.” “We don’t believe that anyone should have to choose between a pet and a home and, working with Simon Community Scotland, we can make that vision a reality.” Hugh Hill, deputy CEO of Simon Community Scotland said: “We know that owning a pet has a hugely positive effect on your mental health and can be a huge source of comfort and security at a time food, energy and housing costs put pressure on the most vulnerable people in our society. “We are excited to be working with the Scottish SPCA to support people to have a safe place to live and help them and their pets stay together particularly as it is often their only source of companionship, comfort, purpose and physical contact.” Scottish Government figures show there were over 35,000 homeless applications in 2021/22 in Scotland, with 130,000 households (including 60,000 children) on waiting lists for social housing. More than 14,000 individuals and families were in temporary accommodation, with an average stay time of over 200 days. Building rates have fallen well behind target, with rising costs making the aim of building 110,000 affordable homes by 2032 totally unrealistic. Join the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. A 2022 survey by the Scottish SPCA showed 70% of people would risk becoming homeless if it meant they could stay with their pet. The two charities plan to run workshops for their people to allow their respective teams to more confidently identify issues around animal welfare and housing. The Scottish SPCA has also added Simon Community Scotland to their animal helpline system to enable the team to track referrals. Simon Community Scotland plan to do the same with their systems so the partnership can build a picture of how each organisation is working with each other and assess the demand between the two services.

175601613,Israel to pull some troops from Gaza as war against Hamas enters new phase,"Israel is withdrawing some forces from Gaza to shift to more targeted operations against Hamas, and is partially returning reservists to civilian life to help the economy as the war looks set to last well into the new year, an Israeli official said. The official said toppling the Islamist faction remained an objective of the offensive in the Palestinian enclave, and that some of the five brigades withdrawn will prepare for a possible flareup of a second front against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Since launching the war in retaliation for the cross-border Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, Israeli officials have said they would wage it in three main stages. The first was intense shelling to clear access routes for ground forces and encourage civilians to evacuate. The second was the invasion that began on Oct. 27. With tanks and troops having now overrun much of the Gaza Strip, largely asserting control despite Palestinian gunmen continuing their ambushes from hidden tunnels and bunkers, the military is moving to the third stage, said the official, who could not be named in print given the sensitivity of the issue. ""This will take six months at least, and involve intense mopping-up missions against the terrorists. No one is talking about doves of peace being flown from Shajaia,"" the official told Reuters, referring to a Gaza district ravaged by fighting. In addition to the 1,200 people killed on Oct. 7, Hamas took some 240 hostage. Israel is also determined to recover the 129 still held in Gaza. Qatari- and Egyptian-mediated truce efforts have raised the prospect of some of them being freed. The shift appeared to correspond to pressure from Israel's top ally, the United States, to review tactics and do more to protect non-combatants. Some troops to move closer to Lebanon Israel initially drafted 300,000 reservists — some 10 to 15 per cent of its workforce — for what looks set to be its longest-ever war. Government sources have said between 200,000 and 250,000 reservists were still mobilized and absent from jobs or studies. The official said two of the brigades being withdrawn were made up of reservists, and described the move as designed to ""re-energize the Israeli economy."" Local media have reported that several military divisions were deployed throughout Gaza. The official added that some of the troops pulled out of Gaza in the south would be prepared for rotation to the northern border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. Next 6 months critical, official says Israel has warned that, if Hezbollah does not back down, a full-on Lebanon war looms. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range attacks against Israel. ""The situation on the Lebanese front will not be allowed to continue. This coming six-month period is a critical moment,"" the official said, adding that Israel would convey a similar message to a U.S. envoy conducting shuttle missions to Beirut. In Gaza, the Israel-Hamas war has inflicted unprecedented devastation, with the health ministry reporting almost 22,000 fatalities, many of them civilian. Israel says it has killed more than 8,000 Palestinian fighters — suggesting that, by its own accounting, Hamas retains core personnel. Pre-war Israeli assessment were that the group had around 30,000 fighters. The Israeli military announced on Saturday it was sending some reservists home as part of what top commander Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi has deemed a ""reconfiguration"" of forces. ""From the first moments of this war, we said it would take long,"" Halevi told troops on Tuesday. ""Will we ultimately be able to say there are no more foes around the State of Israel? I think that is overly ambitious. But we will deliver a different security situation — safe and, as much as possible, stable too."" Israel has listed 174 soldiers — many of them reservists — as killed in Gaza fighting and nine on the Lebanese border.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-hamas-war-day-87-1.7072063?cmp=rss,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7072064.1704110725!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/israel-palestinians-gaza.JPG,2024-01-01 13:26:50,Thomson Reuters,['Thomson Reuters'],en,ca,-0.382
175570131,Kimberly Palmer: Overspent in December? Here’s how to battle the January blues,"The first workday in January after the holidays hits a little bit differently: The parties are over, debt payments are soon due and it can feel like there’s nothing to look forward to. You may be able to minimize the doldrums with some planning and other steps to turn things around, financial experts say. “Financial stress can be temporary,” says Tonya Rapley, financial educator and founder of the millennial money and lifestyle blog My Fab Finance. She suggests focusing on small steps such as paying this month’s bills, then reminding yourself that you can recover from December’s overspending. Here are a few more ways to fight this month’s financial downers: MAKE OR UPDATE A BUDGET The new year is a great time to create or update a budget, which can give you back a sense of control, says Mike Croxson, CEO of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a nonprofit financial coaching organization. The popular 50/30/20 budget, for example, suggests putting 50% of your take-home income toward needs, 30% toward wants and 20% toward savings and any debt payments. You can adjust those percentages as needed, especially if you live in an urban area with high housing costs. “The best way to get control back is to make a plan,” Croxson says. “You can get back on top of this and back to where you feel good about your finances.” PAY OFF DEBT With interest rates higher than they were a couple of years ago, credit card debt is also more expensive, which makes paying it off a financial priority. How exactly you do that is up to you, Croxson says. “Paying off the highest interest rate balance first makes the most common sense, but for some people, paying off the smallest dollar amount first is most important because they feel like they accomplished something,” Croxson says. Small wins can give you momentum to continue. Online calculators for those two methods, known as the avalanche and the snowball, respectively, can help you stay on track. TRACK YOUR PAYMENTS CAREFULLY If you purchased holiday gifts using “buy now, pay later,” which allows shoppers to split payments into multiple installments, then it’s important to note when those bills are due, says Christine Alemany, chief marketing officer for i2c, a global banking and payments platform. Alemany suggests tracking your buy now, pay later due dates with a financial management tool or spreadsheet to avoid late fees or interest charges. “The variety of payment methods that consumers now have gives them the option to choose what’s best for them,” she says, but “that convenience needs to be balanced by discipline.” BUILD UP SAVINGS Amid all of that repayment, it’s also important to find a way to save money, Croxson says. “Having a savings line item in your budget is a critical step for virtually every consumer, even if it’s $20 or $25 a month,” he says. “There will be an emergency, and you will need it.” Being able to turn to savings in the future also helps you avoid building up debt again, he adds. The good news for Americans is that positive signs in the economy, such as a slower rate of inflation and lower gas prices, means it’s a little easier to find room for savings, according to Alan Gin, associate professor of economics at the University of San Diego’s Knauss School of Business. With gas prices coming down, Gin says, “not only will consumers be more confident, but they will have more money.” KNOW YOUR RIGHTS If an expensive item you bought or received as a gift in December breaks in January, that’s another potential downer, which is why knowing your refund rights is critical, says Wayne Hassay, partner attorney for LegalShield, a legal services provider. He suggests keeping track of all paperwork related to the item and any warranty attached whenever you make a big-ticket purchase. In some cases, paying with a credit card can give you additional protections, he adds. And if your pricey new electronics break, don’t hesitate to follow up with the retailer or brand until you get a satisfactory response, which could be a refund or a new product. GET HELP IF YOU NEED IT Working to pay off debt and get back on budget in January can feel lonely because it’s such a solo activity, which is why it’s helpful to reach out for additional support, whether that’s from financial professionals or friends and family. “Be honest with people,” Rapley says. She suggests sharing in a friend group chat if you are looking to scale back and spend less, because you’ll likely find encouragement that can help you stay on track. “That communication is definitely important,” she says, and can help you feel less alone — and with more good things to anticipate in the year ahead. ______________________ This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

175570133,&#8216;Unimaginable excess&#8217;: Bid to attract showy superyachts to Cape Breton under scrutiny,"HALIFAX — Not so long ago, the largest community in Cape Breton was best known as home to one of the most toxic waste sites in North America: the infamous Sydney tar ponds. Containing one million tonnes of oozing sewage and industrial sludge — left behind after centuries of steelmaking — the site has since been capped with concrete and transformed into a sprawling urban park that opened 10 years ago. “It’s a transformation from what was an industrial economy to one that is more service-based with tech businesses and education, ” says Terry Smith, CEO of Destination Cape Breton, the island’s tourism marketing organization. With memories of the tar ponds receding, the port city is now trying to cultivate an upscale vibe — one that includes appealing to billionaires and their toys. It wants to become a destination for superyachts, the most expensive, luxurious boats in the world, which have become the ultimate status symbol for A-list celebrities, dot-com titans and lesser-known oligarchs. Destination Cape Breton has hired Superyacht East Coast, based in Halifax, to attract to the island those who own boats like Archimedes, a 68-metre superyacht believed to be worth about $100 million. According to Superyachts.com, the vessel — as long as a 20-storey building is tall — has a marble Jacuzzi, a grand piano, an enclosed gym, a wood-burning fireplace and six staterooms. Compared to some superyachts, which boast helicopter hangars and glass elevators, Archimedes is considered an understated boat. Owned by U.S. hedge fund billionaire James Simons, the vessel spent at least a week last summer in Cape Breton, moored at the community wharf in Baddeck, N.S., where it caused quite a stir among the locals. “The larger yachts are the ones that people tend to gravitate to,” said Adam Langley, president and CEO of Superyacht East Coast. “They come alongside, and suddenly there’s hundreds of people around buying ice cream or lunch and taking in the environment that these boats create.” And the economic benefits don’t end there, Langley said. The owners of these floating mansions typically spend a small fortune on provisions after they arrive in port. Once Archimedes had completed its eight-week tour of Canada’s East Coast, the captain told Saltscapes magazine that its owner had spent US$400,000 on fuel, groceries, tours, guides and entertainment. “Think of them as large, floating resorts,” Langley said in a recent interview. “They’ll spend thousands of dollars on things like flowers.” But Tom Urbaniak says there needs to be a broader discussion about using public funds to attract superyachts to the East Coast. “What this is really about is marketing to an infinitesimally small group of oligarchs, the uber-rich, hyper-celebrities and the people who swoon around them,” said Urbaniak, professor of political science and director of the Tompkins Institute at Cape Breton University in Sydney. “This is not just a celebration of wealth. This is a celebration of almost unimaginable excess.” The professor says that at a time when Canadians are being asked to make sacrifices to deal with climate change, it doesn’t make sense to cater to rich people who flaunt their wealth in vessels that leave a massive carbon footprint. “I haven’t seen anything from Destination Cape Breton that there will be some kind of standard set to determine which ones get welcomed based on whether they pay taxes …. and whether they subscribe to the rule of law,” Urbaniak said. Smith says attracting superyachts is a small part of a broader strategy aimed at getting more boaters to come to the region. And he challenged the argument that superyacht owners represent the worst kind of polluters. “I don’t agree with that,” said Smith, whose non-profit organization gets most of its budget from a levy charged to those who pay for accommodations in Cape Breton, as well the provincial and federal governments. “There are electric superyachts now. I think we’re going to see a transformation in them in terms of cleaner fuels and cleaner ways of operating.” As for courting oligarchs, Langley says they’re not coming to Atlantic Canada anyway. “We see more explorer yachts that are not the huge, 600- and 400-foot superyachts,” he said, adding that superyacht builders are now keen on using hydrogen technology to propel their boats. “These are usually 200 feet and less, and they’re usually owned by people who are very sensitive to where they are going and operated by captains who are respectful (of the environment).” Meanwhile, Langley says he’s working on a marine tourism strategy for Nova Scotia that will include sections on sustainability and best practices for marinas and waterfronts. “I am very sensitive to that,” he said. “I grew up in Nova Scotia along the Northumberland Strait and I’m lucky enough to have a place in Baddeck …. These places are very special.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 1, 2024.

175595179,Various dimensions of the conflict in the Red Sea,"By P.K.Balachandran/Ceylon Today Colombo, January 1: The sustained attacks on international merchant shipping in the Red Sea by the Houthis of Yemen in support of the Hamas in the Gaza war, have brought the Houthis and the issues they throw up, to the world’s centre stage. The issue around the Houthis has multiple dimensions. Firstly, there is the Shiite-Sunni conflict in Yemen involving Iran and Saudi Arabia. Secondly, there is the pan-Islamic conflict with the Western countries and Israel. And thirdly, there is the economic vulnerability of the world’s powers who depend on the Red Sea being a conflict-free pathway for trade. The Houthis’ attacks on merchant shipping in the Red Sea are a direct threat to the world powers’ basic interest, which is a smooth flow of world trade. Major merchant shipping lines are now avoiding the Red Sea and are going around Africa. This will cause a rise in the cost of freight, a rise in prices at the consumers’ end, and delays in delivery. And last but not the least, the conflict in the Red Sea will divert the West’s attention (and consequently the world’s attention) from the Gaza conflict. That conflict, which has already taken 20,000 Palestinian lives, seems fated to continue indefinitely with both sides wanting to fight to the finish. Importance of Red Sea According to Al Jazeera, 12% of world trade; 12% of oil trade; and 8% of CNG trade pass through the Red Sea. And 8.8 million barrels of oil and 4.1 million cubic feet of LNG traverse it per day. The United States has formed a 20-nation international force under a project entitled “Operation Prosperity Guardian” to combat the Houthis. The Indian Navy deployed Guided Missile Destroyers INS Mormugao, INS Kochi and INS Kolkata, and also long-range maritime reconnaissance P8I aircraft in the area after the merchant vessel MV Chem Pluto, with 21 Indian crew members, was struck by a drone about 217 nautical miles from Porbandar last Saturday. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince on Tuesday and the two leaders “agreed to work together for peace, security and stability” in the West Asia region. In a post on X, Modi said, “Held a good conversation with my Brother HRH Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud on the future of Strategic Partnership between India and Saudi Arabia. We exchanged views on the West Asia situation and shared concerns regarding terrorism, violence and the loss of civilian lives. Agreed to work together for peace, security and stability in the region.” A statement by the Indian Prime Minister’s Office added that the two leaders emphasised “the need for maintaining maritime security and the freedom of navigation.” Iran’s Role According to the Western powers, the Houthis, being Shiites, are a proxy of Shiite Iran and that Iran has been supplying weapons to the Houthis to take on Israel and Arab nations like Saudi Arabia which are soft on Israel. But Iran has flatly denied the charge and insists that the Houthis are acting on their own accord. Nevertheless, the Houthis and Iran have common cause. One of them is to promote the Shiites vis-à-vis the Sunnis in the Islamic world’s power struggles. The other is that both have a deep grudge against the Americans, their allies in the Arab world and Israel. Apart from these, the Houthis have their own reasons to take on the US, Israel and the West in general. Yemeni Politics The Houthis’ raison d'etre is in the politics of Yemen essentially. The Houthi are a militant movement in northern Yemen. The movement was initiated by the , a Yemeni politician and political activist from the Zaydi sect of Shiite Islam. The objective of the Houthi movement is to promote Zaydi revivalism. The movement calls itself Anṣar Allah (“Defenders of God”) but is popularly known as the “Houthi movement” acknowledging the role of its founder, Hussein Badr al-Din al-Houthi. Since 2004 the Houthi movement has been in armed rebellion against Yemen’s internationally recognized government. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Zaydis have been one of Yemen’s main political constituencies. In 1962 the Imam of the Zaydis was overthrown and forced into exile. A military regime—the Yemen Arab Republic—was set up in place of the Imamate. This was met with fierce resistance from the Zaydis. The military regime kept thwarting the Zaydi elites’ political ambitions. In the 1970s there was an injection of Wahhabism (i.e., a Saudi Sunni sect) that undermined the core of the Zaydi doctrine and challenged the authority of Zaydi elites. In retaliation, the Shiite Zaydis embraced Shiite symbols, fostered by Iran, openly, creating tension with the Yemeni Wahhabis who were inspired by the Saudis. In 1990, the Yemen Arab Republic and the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen to its south were united. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, unification offered a political opening for Zaydis and the Zaydi elites formed the Al-Ḥaqq Party. But the Al Haqq party was in sharp conflict with the Wahhabist Al Iṣlaḥ (Reform) Party. The charismatic Al-Ḥaqq founder-leader, Hussein Badr al-Din al-Houthi, began fostering the “Believing Youth”, a network of Zaydi youths intended to challenge Wahhabi youth networks. The “Believing Youth” initially received support from Yemen’s government, but its growing popularity and its criticism of President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s government led to State aid being cut off in 2000. The conflict sharpened after President Saleh supported the US “War on Terror” in 2001 and the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Saleh regime began cracking down on the Al Haqq. During the armed resistance, the Al Haqq leader, Hussein Houthi, was killed by Yemeni government forces. The leadership of the movement of Al Haqq passed on to his brother Abdul Malik al Houthi. Al Haqq’s armed resistance to the Saleh government increased following popular dissatisfaction against it. After the Arab Spring protests in Tunisia and Egypt toppled their respective Presidents in early 2011, Yemenis called for the end of the Saleh regime. In November, Saleh signed an internationally mediated agreement to hand power to his Vice President, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. But Sleh was the power behind Hadi. The Hadi Presidency gave more importance to the Wahhabi Al Iṣlaḥ Party, to Al Haqq’s chagrin. In July 2014, Hadi’s administration cut fuel subsidies to address the widening budget deficit. Popular protests erupted. In September 2014, Yemeni security forces opened fire on protesters in the capital Sanaa, killing several. This escalated armed confrontation culminated in the Houthi takeover of parts of Sanaa. In late January 2015, Houthi fighters occupied the presidential palace, and Hadi was forced to resign. But the following month, Hadi emerged in Aden and retracted his resignation. He also secured international military intervention to drive back the Houthi rebels from Sanaa. A Saudi-led campaign against the Houthi rebels began in March 2015. Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia, where he set up a government in exile. The United Nations made efforts to mediate between the belligerents. But the negotiations failed. In late 2017, Saleh announced his readiness to engage in dialogue on the demands of the Saudi-led coalition. But the Houthis ousted Saleh’s forces from Sanaa and, on December 4, killed Saleh. The port city of Al-Ḥudaydah (Hodeidah) was the primary source of imports and revenue for the Houthi rebellion. In June 2018 the Saudi-led coalition advanced on Hodeidah. But, because the port was also a lifeline for humanitarian aid, the United Nations intervened and mediated a cease-fire that came into effect in December, the Encyclopaedia Britannia says. The Houthi rebels were presenting an increasingly formidable challenge for the Saudi-led coalition. Not only did they gain ground against the coalition in Yemen, but struck Saudi territory with drones and missiles. The Houthis claimed responsibility for an attack in September 2019 on the oil-processing facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia. The Western powers said that Iran’s clandestine “Quds Force” was responsible for the growing sophistication of Houthi attacks. But Iran refuted this allegation. Place of Gaza Crisis The Gaza crisis which began on October 7 added another reason for the Houthis’ conflict with Israel, the US and Saudi Arabia. The Houthis put the Shiite-Sunni conflict on the backburner and openly expressed support for the Hamas which is a Sunni organization. The Houthis’ struggle has many strands. They stand for the Zaydi community, Shiism, anti-Wahhabism, as well anti-Western imperialism, all in go. They seek to defeat Israel in Gaza. Their attacks against Western shipping in the Red Sea are an expression of the support to Hamas. The Houthis are likely to carry on this fight regardless of the opposition from the world’s powers. Most recently, the Houthis staged a drone attack on the Israeli pott of Eilat, directly challenging Israel. An end to the turmoil in the Middle East is therefore not in sight. On the contrary, exacerbation is on the cards.

175586561,Former LRA Rebels Seek Forgiveness and Reintegration in Uganda,"Former combatants of the notorious Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) have made a heartfelt plea to the Ugandan government and local communities in the Acholi sub-region, seeking forgiveness for the atrocities they were coerced into committing during their time with the rebel group. Representing the returnees, Doctor Acaye, one of 141 ex-LRA members repatriated from the Central African Republic (CAR), expressed deep remorse, highlighting their forced conscription and the harrowing experiences they endured. “We were forcefully abducted and compelled to do unimaginable things. We ask for forgiveness and want to return to our country, Uganda, as citizens who were tragically torn away from our families,” Acaye lamented. The returnees, comprising 35 men, one woman, 27 spouses, and 78 children, defected from Joseph Kony’s elusive LRA camp six years ago. They resided in Mboki and Zemio in southeastern CAR before their recent repatriation. Acaye emphasized their voluntary defection and the sincere desire to reintegrate into society as law-abiding citizens. Archbishop John Baptist Odama, leading a prayer for the returnees, conveyed the religious leaders’ message of absolution, urging them to shed their guilt and embrace a fresh start. Gulu LC V chairperson Christopher Opiyo Atekere highlighted the logistical challenges faced by the returnees, advocating for their seamless acquisition of national identification to be recognized as Ugandan citizens. He also appealed to the government for resettlement assistance, drawing parallels with the Bududa resettlement initiative, proposing land allocation and housing support for their smoother reintegration. State Minister for Northern Uganda, Grace Freedom Kwiyucwiny, commended the returnees for renouncing rebellion and emphasized ongoing efforts within the Ministry of Internal Affairs to accommodate individuals without parental identification in the national registration process. Brig. Gen Dr. Patrick Ocen, representing the ministry of Defence and Veteran Affairs, confirmed plans to issue certificates of amnesty to the ex-LRA combatants, signaling a step towards their legal reintegration into society. The returnees’ repatriation was facilitated by NGOs PAX and APRu, specializing in LRA defection in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo and CAR. These organizations pledged extensive support, including school fees, specialized meals, and medical care during the returnees’ rehabilitation in Gulu. As Uganda grapples with reconciling its past conflicts, the return of these former LRA fighters represents a poignant plea for forgiveness, reconciliation, and a second chance at rebuilding their lives within their homeland.

175571371,"‘Completely alienated’: British Muslims on Labour, Tory stance on Gaza war","London, United Kingdom — Visiting Tel Aviv in mid-October, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stood next to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, who had launched a devastating war on Gaza following the October 7 Hamas attacks on southern Israel. “We want you to win,” Sunak told Netanyahu before the cameras. More than two months later, the United Kingdom’s support for Israel’s war has remained largely unqualified, even as Israeli bombs and artillery firing have killed more than 21,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including more than 8,000 children. But whatever a “win” might look like for Israel, Sunak’s Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party, whose leader Keir Starmer has also backed Netanyahu’s war, have both lost voters like Ala Sirriyeh, a senior lecturer in sociology at Lancaster University. “It has shown very starkly who they are prepared to throw under the bus to get elected, whose welfare matters and whose does not,” she told Al Jazeera. “As a Palestinian, I feel completely alienated from the major political parties [in the UK] and will not be voting for either of them in the near future.” She is not alone. As Israel continues to bomb Palestinians in Gaza, a coalition of political groups, worker’s unions, students, healthcare professionals, journalists, writers, and common people from all walks of life have been organising in the UK, urging their political leadership to call for a ceasefire. The protesters, day in and day out have occupied public spaces and weapons factories and marched across city centres and university campuses. Thousands of people have signed petitions calling for a ceasefire. Yet, as leaders across both major parties have stayed firm in their support for Israel, they face a particular crisis of credibility among British Muslims, who constitute 6.7 percent of the population and traditionally largely vote in support of the Labour Party. “It is deeply distressing to see these calls for a ceasefire being ignored or shut down,” Sirriyeh said. In a survey involving 30,000 Muslim participants conducted in late October by the Muslim Census, an organisation based in the UK, only 5 percent of the respondents said they would vote for Labour in the next general elections. That is much lower compared with 71 percent of British Muslims who voted for the party in 2019. The Conservative Party, which drew 9 percent of the Muslim vote in 2019, would get less than 1 percent of the votes of those sampled in that survey. In another survey of 1,032 Muslims across the UK, more than two-thirds expressed dissatisfaction with the British government’s response to the Israeli assault on Gaza. Nearly half of the respondents conveyed similar sentiments regarding Starmer’s approach to the crisis, though a majority still backed the Labour Party. And it is not just Muslims in the UK. In a YouGov poll of overall public sentiments published on November 15, a third of the participants said the UK government should oppose Israel’s war and push for a ceasefire. Another quarter of those who participated called for a limited ceasefire. Only 9 percent opposed any kind of a ceasefire while backing Israel’s military aims. “I have seen the conversations, and perceptions, regarding this issue shift substantially in favour of Palestine,” Arooj, a schoolteacher in her 20s who has participated in protest rallies, told Al Jazeera. Arooj said she was not comfortable sharing her full name, at a time when many pro-Palestinian protesters have been targeted at their workplaces. Even a month after that survey, however, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron refused to back an immediate ceasefire, in an op-ed, written in collaboration with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock. “We do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is the way forward,” they wrote, blaming Hamas for the crisis. Starmer too has refused to back a full end to fighting in Gaza, instead calling for a “sustainable ceasefire”, a phrase that Tayib Ali, the director of the UK-based International Centre of Justice for Palestinians, termed a “weak and watered down call”. During a parliamentary vote on a ceasefire resolution, introduced by the Scottish Nationalist Party, Starmer threatened Labour members with expulsion if they voted in favour. Earlier, in a radio interview, the Labour leader backed Israel’s decision to withhold water and electricity from Gaza. Meanwhile, United Nations experts and leading human rights groups have warned that Israel is likely committing war crimes and that its actions might amount to genocide, as South Africa has alleged in a case before the International Court of Justice. Sirriyeh said she believes the Labour leadership’s reluctance to criticise Israel stems from fears that allegations of anti-Semitism might be weaponised against the party. “Given the critiques levied at the Labour Party during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership about the party’s failure to address alleged anti-Semitism within its ranks, there is a wariness among politicians for calling for a ceasefire and calling out Israeli war crimes,” she said. Starmer has faced a revolt from sections of his party over his stance. Imran Hussain, a front bench MP and shadow minister, in his resignation letter to Starmer, said a ceasefire was essential to ending the suffering of people in Gaza. Accusing Israel of inflicting war crimes and collective punishment, Hussain wrote, “The situation in Gaza is now beyond that of a humanitarian catastrophe.” Condemning Starmer’s support for Israel’s policy of withholding water and electricity from Gaza, at least 23 Labour councillors left the party. Shaista Aziz, one among them, wrote that the Labour leader had “horrifyingly endorsed the collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza”. But it is on the streets that Arooj sees the future of pro-Palestinian solidarity in the UK, in the form of young people — including schoolchildren — who have marched against the war. Polling shows that younger people in the UK lean significantly in support of Palestine. “The younger generation gives me hope,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/1/completely-alienated-british-muslims-on-labour-tory-stance-on-gaza-war?traffic_source=rss,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AP23329566763663-1704110108.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,2024-01-01 13:29:55,"Apps Support, Umar Lateef Misgar","['Apps Support', 'Umar Lateef Misgar']",en,qa,0.111
175571099,IIT Kharagpur Director stresses on branding of premier tech institutes,"IIT Kharagpur Director V K Tewari has stressed on the need for branding of the premier tech institution and claimed it will be among the top 10 higher educational institutions of the world by 2030. Tewari said this while interacting with the alumni in a virtual meeting last week. Advocating the need ""for involving students in a more cohesive manner,"" he said, ""We need to do a lot of branding as IIT KGP, we need to work on our limitations, we have to work on certain areas"". He said IIT Kharagpur is the first IIT in the country. ""We have to think very very big. We have to take strong steps, we have to follow Modi ji's ideal for an Atmanirbhar Bharat. We should be targeting to be among the top 10 in the world,"" he added. Referring to the call by President Droupadi Murmu to pitchfork IIT Kharagpur among the top 50 in the world in the Convocation held in December 2023, Tewari said ""the Hon'ble President said 50. One of our senior officials set the target of being within 25. However, I am setting the target to be within top 10 higher educational institutions in the world"". In the QS Asia World University Ranking for 2024, IIT Kharagpur occupied overall fifth rank in India and 59th in Asia. The largest and first IIT in the country made its entry at the top of the QS Asia University rankings with an overall score of 54.5, the institute said in a statement on November 11. Tewari claimed IIT Kharagpur will be among the top 10 higher educational institutions in the world by 2030. He suggested more academia-industry collaborations for which the institute needed to work with faculties and alumni and called for a higher number of collaborations with front-ranking world universities for the need to open up. ""The DRDO set up a centre of excellence (DIA-CoE).

175572753,"Israel moving thousands of troops out of Gaza, but expects ""prolonged fighting"" with Hamas","Tel Aviv — Israel's military has begun moving thousands of troops out of the Gaza Strip, but officials stress that the Israel Defense Forces are set to continue waging a long war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The announcement of a redeployment came after Israel's prime minister said he saw the conflict continuing well into the new year.Thousands of Israeli soldiers were being shifted out of Gaza, however, military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters on Monday, in the first significant drawdown since the war was sparked by Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7 terror attack on southern Israel. In a statement, the IDF said five brigades, or several thousand troops, would be moved out of Gaza over the coming weeks for training and rest. In a briefing Sunday when he first announced the troop withdrawal, without specifying how many forces were leaving, Hagari did not say whether the decision meant Israel was launching a new phase of the war. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas' military and governing capabilities in Gaza, a small Palestinian territory which the group — long designated a terror organization by Israel and the U.S. — has ruled for almost two decades. Hamas' attack on Israel left about 1,200 people dead and saw the militants take some 240 people hostage. The troop movement could indicate a scaling back of Israel's war effort in some parts of densely populated Gaza, most likely in the northern half of the enclave where the IDF focused the initial phase of its offensive. Israel, a close U.S. ally in the heart of the tumultuous Middle East, has been under mounting pressure from the Biden administration to switch to lower-intensity fighting amid escalating death toll reports from Gaza, where Hamas officials say more than 20,000 people have been killed. But Hagari made it clear that Israel's war with Hamas was not yet over.""The objectives of the war require prolonged fighting, and we are preparing accordingly,"" he said.Nor is it over for Hamas, and as the clock struck midnight local time, it was sirens that rang in the new year across Israel on Monday morning. Hamas fired a barrage of rockets, lighting up the sky for revelers in Tel Aviv as Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of them. No injuries were reported.In Gaza, there was no happy new year. Thousands of Palestinians have spent weeks crammed into tents in the southern city of Rafah, huddling close to stay warm. Many in the camps lost a mother, father, husband, wife, brother, sister, child or grandchild in 2023, and they fear the new year will only bring more of the same. ""My tragedy lives inside me,"" said Kamal al-Zeinaty, one of the many displaced. ""The outside world does not feel it at all. Let them have their celebrations and leave me to live in tragedy.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-idf-moving-troops-out-of-gaza-but-expects-prolonged-fight/,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/01/01/65b19f30-b618-49fc-b678-410eb4bdc77e/thumbnail/1200x630/77d9469c767db40f9bd454bda743d503/israel-gaza-1891257614.jpg?v=5382e209c94ee904b3a96a69f8ca0ce0,2024-01-01 13:33:25,Ian Lee,['Ian Lee'],en,us,-0.1
175582051,Israeli army says Gaza war will continue throughout 2024,"Israel warned its war against Hamas will continue throughout 2024 as unrelenting strikes killed two dozen people in Gaza and the Palestinian militant group fired a rocket barrage at the stroke of midnight. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a New Year's message that some of the 300,000 army reservists would get a break from the war, in order to prepare for the ""prolonged fighting"" ahead. The army ""must plan ahead, understanding that we will be required for additional tasks and warfare throughout this year,"" Hagari said as the conflict sparked by the October 7 Hamas attacks raged on. Heavy artillery fire again pounded targets in Hamas-run Gaza, killing at least 24 people, health ministry officials there said, with attacks reported across the length of the territory. In the besieged Gaza Strip, where the UN says 85 percent of the population has been displaced, 20-year-old Hamdan Abu Arab said he hoped ""2024 will be better"". ""We used to go out and enjoy our time on the last day of the year,"" he recalled. ""But this New Year's Eve, there are only missiles and the remains of people."" Hamas marked the start of the year by firing a rocket barrage at Israel in what it called a ""response to the massacres of civilians"". AFP journalists in Tel Aviv witnessed missile defence systems intercept rockets overhead as some revellers ran for cover and others kept up the party with a shrug. ""My heart was pounding,"" said one, Gabriel Zemelman, 26, shortly after the rocket fire. ""It's terrifying. You just saw the life we live, it's crazy."" The bloodiest ever Gaza war was triggered by Hamas' October 7 attacks in south Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. The militants also took around 250 people hostage that day, more than half of whom remain in Gaza, according to Israeli officials. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and launched a punishing offensive that has reduced vast areas of Gaza to a ruined wasteland and killed at least 21,822 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry. The Israeli army says 172 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza in the battle against the Islamist militant group which Israel, the United States and European Union have designated a ""terrorist"" organisation. - 'We live like animals' - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Saturday that the fighting would last ""many months until Hamas is eliminated and the hostages are returned"". Hagari said ""we are also currently adapting the planning of the force deployment in Gaza and the reserve system. Some of the reservists will return to their families and employment this week. ""This will significantly ease the burden on the economy and allow them to gather strength for the upcoming activities in the next year, as the fighting will continue and they will still be required."" Since Israel imposed a siege at the outset of the war, Gazans have been facing dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. UN chief Antonio Guterres has condemned the ""epic human suffering"" and ""collective punishment"" of Palestinian civilians, while the WHO has warned of the risk of hunger and infectious disease. ""We are exhausted... We were displaced five times during this war,"" said 29-year-old Bassam Hana. ""We hope things improve in 2024 and that we live just like any other human being. Currently, we live like animals."" At least 48 Palestinians were killed in strikes on Gaza City over the weekend, the territory's health ministry said, with many still buried under the rubble. ""After the explosion we arrived at the scene of the strike and saw martyrs everywhere,"" said one resident after a building was hit. ""Children are still missing, we can't find them."" Hagari, in a briefing on Sunday, said several militants ""were killed and subdued during the battles in Khan Yunis"", the main southern city, earlier in the day. ""We are continuing to handle the underground tunnels and to strike the rocket launching array, in order to reduce rocket fire into the State of Israel,"" he said, adding that ""dozens of aircrafts are in the skies of Gaza at any given moment"". - Regional fears - International mediators have continued efforts toward a new pause in fighting. A Hamas delegation from Qatar visited Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian three-phase plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the war, sources close to Hamas said. Their allies Islamic Jihad said on Saturday that Palestinian factions were evaluating the proposal and would give a response ""within days."" The war in Gaza has raised fears of a broader regional conflict, with hostilities flaring with mostly Iran-backed militant groups in nearby countries who say they are acting in support of Hamas. The Israeli army announced Sunday night having intercepted two ""hostile aircraft"" launched from Syria towards northern Israel. Earlier it had reported launches toward Israeli territory from Lebanon, where it has fought Hezbollah. ""Throughout the day, IDF (military) tanks and helicopters targeted three terrorist squads operating in Lebanon,"" the army said in a statement. And in the Red Sea, the U.S. military said Sunday that Navy helicopters had fired at Iran-backed Huthi rebel boats off Yemen that were attacking a cargo ship, with Yemeni sources reporting 10 rebels killed.",https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/302482-israeli-army-says-gaza-war-will-continue-throughout-2024,http://images2.naharnet.com/images/258685/w140.jpg?1704112405,2024-01-01 13:33:29,Naharnet Newsdesk,['Naharnet Newsdesk'],en,lb,0.194
175576961,"Bring Mary’s gratitude and hope into the new year, pope says - OSV News","VATICAN CITY (CNS) — On New Year’s Eve, believers and non-believers alike give thanks for all they have received in the last 12 months and express their hopes for the coming year, but Christians are called to cultivate their gratitude and hope following the example of Mary, Pope Francis said. “Faith enables us to live this hour in a way different than that of a worldly mindset,” the pope said during an evening prayer service in St. Peter’s Basilica Dec. 31. “Faith in Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, born of the Virgin Mary, gives a new way of feeling time and life.” Pope Francis said that while many people express thanks and hope on New Year’s Eve, in reality, they often “lack the essential dimension which is that of relationship with the Other and with others, with God and with brothers and sisters.” With a worldly mentality, gratitude and hope are “flattened onto the self, onto one’s interests,” he said. “They don’t go beyond satisfaction and optimism.” Pope Francis encouraged Christians to look to the example of Mary who, after giving birth to Jesus, had a mother’s gratitude in her heart for bearing the child of God. “Mystery makes room for gratitude, which surfaces in the contemplation of gift, in gratuitousness, while it suffocates in the anxiety of having and appearing,” the pope said. “The church learns gratitude from the Virgin Mary.” The pope also said that the hope of Mary and the church “is not optimism, it is something else: it is faith in a God faithful to his promises.” “This faith takes the form of hope in the dimension of time,” he said. “Christians, like Mary, are pilgrims of hope.” Near the basilica’s main altar was an icon of the “Madonna Lactans,” or Nursing Madonna, from the Benedictine Abbey of Montevirgine in Mercogliano, Italy. The icon, in late Byzantine style, shows Mary nursing the infant Jesus. The pope prayed silently before the image before leaving the basilica. The service culminated with the choir and the 6,500 people present in the basilica singing the “Te Deum” (“We praise you, oh God”) in thanksgiving for the blessings of the past year. In his homily, Pope Francis noted that the coming year would involve intense preparation for the Holy Year 2025. Yet more than worrying about organizing logistics and events, the pope asked people to be witnesses to “ethical and spiritual quality of coexistence.” As an example, he pointed out that people of every nationality, culture and religion come together in St. Peter’s Square, so the basilica must be welcoming to all people and provide accessible information. The pope then praised charm of Rome’s historic center but said it must also be accessible to people with disabilities and the elderly. Roberto Gualtieri, mayor of Rome, sat in the front of row of the basilica during the prayer service and greeted the pope at its conclusion. Pope Francis noted that a pilgrimage “requires good preparation,” and recalled that 2024 would be dedicated to prayer before the Holy Year. “And what better teacher could we have than our holy Mother?” the pope asked. “Let us learn from her to live every day, every moment, every occupation with our inner gaze turned to Jesus.” After the prayer service, the pope greeted people lined along the basilica’s central nave. Then, riding in his wheelchair, he went outside to pray in front of the Nativity scene in St. Peter’s Square, taking his time to wave to visitors, bless children and listen to the Swiss Guard band as it played Christmas carols.",https://www.osvnews.com/2024/01/01/bring-marys-gratitude-and-hope-into-the-new-year-pope-says/,https://www.osvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/123123_TeDeum-5-1024x576.jpg,2024-01-01 13:34:53,Justin McLellan,['Justin McLellan'],en,us,0.335

175576491,Ex-Cycling World Champion Dennis Reportedly Charged After Olympian Wife Killed by Vehicle,"ADELAIDE, Australia—Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis was reported to have been charged in connection with the death of his wife, Olympic cyclist Melissa Hoskins, who died after being struck by a vehicle while riding in Adelaide. Australian media reports said Mr. Dennis had been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, endangering life, and driving without due care. The reports said he had been released on bail to appear at the Adelaide Magistrates Court in March. Ms. Hoskins, 32, competed for Australia at the London and Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Police said emergency services were called to an address in Medindie, an Adelaide suburb, around 8 p.m. Saturday, following reports a woman had been struck by a vehicle. Police said the woman, later identified as Ms. Hoskins, suffered serious injuries and died after being taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Ms. Hoskins competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics on the track in the team pursuit and was in the squad that won the 2015 world title in the event. “Melissa described her team pursuit gold medal at the 2015 world championships as the highlight of her career but for the rest of us, the highlight was just having her around,” AusCyling chief executive Marne Fechner said in a statement Monday. “Although she retired in 2017, her presence as an alumnus of the sport has been felt and appreciated by many in the cycling and riding community.” Ms. Hoskins also competed in road cycling for several years with the Australian team GreenEDGE. The 33-year-old Mr. Dennis won two world titles in the road time trial, as well as silver in the team pursuit at the London Olympics and bronze in the road time trial at the Tokyo Olympics. He became the seventh Australian to wear the yellow jersey as race leader at the Tour de France by winning the opening time trial in 2015, setting a race record for his average speed. Mr. Dennis, who has retired from competitive cycling, was named Australian Cyclist of the year in 2015 and 2018 and won the 2015 Tour Down Under in his home city of Adelaide. After his retirement and their marriage in 2018, the Dennis family relocated to Adelaide from Europe. Ms. Hoskins and Mr. Dennis were this month scheduled to take part in an event at the Tour Down Under in Adelaide. “We are devastated by the news of Melissa Hoskins death. It’s an extremely tragic situation which has seen the loss of a young mum and champion cyclist,” Tour Down Under organizers said in a statement Monday. “Given the circumstances, Rohan Dennis will no longer be participating.”",https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/ex-cycling-world-champion-dennis-reportedly-charged-after-olympian-wife-killed-by-vehicle-5556248,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/01/01/id5556259-Rohan-Dennis-300x180.jpg,2024-01-01 13:37:20,The Associated Press,['The Associated Press'],en,us,0.05
175573681,Column: How does this Chicago Bears run defense match up with dominant teams of the past? The numbers don&#8217;t lie.,"There is a link between the 2023 Chicago Bears and past teams, including the division champions in 2018 and 2001 and even the Super Bowl XX champions of 1985. The run defense this season is every bit as good as it was for the dominant defenses of those successful teams. In fact, with two games remaining, Matt Eberflus’ team has a shot at being the best run defense in Bears history, a remarkable possibility when considering last year’s team ranked 31st in the NFL allowing 157.3 yards per game, the organization’s second-worst season in the Super Bowl era (161.4 yards per game in 2013). It’s the same scheme — a base Tampa Two defense that, historically can have a weakness against the run — with mostly the same coaches and many of the same players. General manager Ryan Poles wasn’t oblivious to the problem a year ago when five opponents rushed for 200 or more yards against the Bears. He responded by bucking up at the linebacker position and signing Tremaine Edmunds ($72 million, four years) and T.J. Edwards ($19.5 million, three years) and adding nose tackle Andrew Billings to a $2.75 million, one-year contract. The improvements have been striking. Entering Week 17, the Bears (6-9) are No. 1 in the NFL against the run, allowing 80.7 yards per game, nearly 77 yards better than last year’s defense. With games against the Atlanta Falcons (eighth in the league in rushing offense) and Green Bay Packers remaining, Eberflus’ team is in a position to rank with the best in club history. 2018: 80.0 yards per game 2023: 80.7 yards per game 2001: 82.1 yards per game 1985: 82.4 yards per game “Wow,” Edmunds said when presented with the statistics. “I didn’t know that. It would mean a lot.” Finding help at linebacker was an obvious goal for Poles after trading Roquan Smith last year. Adding Billings on a bargain deal proved shrewd and the former 3-4 nose tackle, slimmed down a little to 311 pounds for the scheme, already earned an $8 million, two-year extension. “They expected me to come in here and make an impact, to be that rock in the middle of the defense,” Billings said. “They wanted to improve the run D and they stressed that to me.” The run defense got even better with the Oct. 31 trade for end Montez Sweat, who has made an impact with six sacks and 13 quarterback hits in seven games. Sweat has been as advertised since arriving, as former Washington Commanders pro scout Donnie Warren said he was a tremendous two-way player — meaning he’s just as good defending the run as he is harassing quarterbacks. It’s eye-opening that the defense could be catapulted from near the bottom of the league to the top with four new players who have a combined total of two Pro Bowl selections — both by Edmunds. “It’s a want-to,” tackle Justin Jones said. “There is no secret recipe to it. You’ve got to want to beat the man in front of you. That’s kind of how I see it. We had a bunch of guys that take pride in that and then obviously bringing (Sweat) in, having him settling into our foundational stuff we do, obviously stop the run first, and then get the quarterback, it’s fun to see.” The Bears have started reaping the benefits that come with stopping the run on first and second down and putting opposing offenses behind the chains. They rank second in the NFL with 18 interceptions — only the San Francisco 49ers (19) have more. They’ve allowed 558 yards rushing on first-and-10, the second-lowest total in the league. They’ve become a good pass-rushing unit since Sweat arrived, with 17 sacks and 49 QB hits in seven games. “There are a lot of things, and I hate to get on the negative side, that we’re still trying to improve on,” Edmunds said. “I’m not going to neglect the fact that would mean a lot to us (to set a franchise record). It shows the hard work guys have put in. We’re not satisfied where we are and I think the main message now is to continue to get better. ” There are some basic metrics the Bears want to improve. They’re tied for 21st in scoring, allowing 21.0 points per game. The Bears are 12th in yardage (318.1), 29th on third down (43.8%), 32nd in the red zone (72.5%) and with the midseason start in getting after quarterbacks they’re 31st in sack rate (4.89%). At Halas Hall, the team has to believe that with some offseason moves and Sweat in place for the start of 2024, they will be better across the board. The Bears are tied for fourth in the league in explosive plays allowed, defined as 20 yards for a passing play and 10 for rushing plays, and that’s significant. Any more, defensive coaches are more concerned with eliminating big plays than they are with stopping the run. The Bears have excelled in both areas and the success against the run, assuming it can be carried into next season, suggests other improvements will follow. “First things first, to be a good defense you’ve got to stop the run,” said Edwards, who is seventh in the league with 141 tackles. “That’s really our goal and was a heavy point of emphasis coming into this year. It’s not always been perfect or anything like that. We’re not worried about the stats right now. We just want to play good team defense. That starts up front and that starts with how you defend the run and try to make opponents as one-dimensional as you can.” The ability to get an opponent behind the sticks is going to lead to more pass-rushing situations and with that, in theory, should come more opportunities for takeaways. The ability to stop the run without loading the box is also paramount because that can leave passing windows open on the back end. “Facts,” Jones said. Yes, the dominant run defenses the Bears have had in the past were all part of very successful teams in the franchise’s rich history. The current group has to look at this development as a steppingstone. “It’s cool,” Jones said. “You want to win more with it.” ()",https://www.twincities.com/2024/01/01/column-how-does-this-chicago-bears-run-defense-match-up-with-dominant-teams-of-the-past-the-numbers-dont-lie-2/,https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/202312290716TMS_____MNGTRPUB_SPORTS-COLUMN-HOW-DOES-THIS-CHICAGO-BEARS-3-TB5.jpg?w=1024,2024-01-01 13:38:00,Tribune News Service,['Tribune News Service'],en,us,0.153
175572901,"Attack on Manipur cops, search on to nab rebels: Team to apprise leaders in Delhi of situation","Imphal: The security forces Monday continued their search to nab the suspected Kuki militants, who attacked Manipur Police commandos Saturday and Sunday, injuring five personnel seriously. Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh also expressed concern over the attacks on the forces and said that a delegation would soon go to Delhi to apprise the central leaders on the prevailing situation in the state. A senior police officer said that additional security forces have been deployed in Moreh and adjoining areas in the state’s Tengnoupal district, along Myanmar, and the state and the central forces continued their combing operations to nab the suspected Kuki militants. The injured personnel — Diliangam Kamson, M Priyokumar, N Borjao, M Sunil, and Ponkhalung — were given first aid at the Assam Rifles camp in Moreh and then brought to Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal, the officer said. Several tribal organisations alleged that many houses of Kuki-Zo tribals were burnt down by the attackers in Moreh area since Saturday. The Manipur Chief Minister, posting his statement on X, said, “The unprecedented attacks against the state forces in the recent times have become a serious national security threat. While the state and central security forces are actively engaged in maintaining control over the situation, it is also imperative for the combined security forces to adopt a robust and comprehensive approach to deal with these elements, who are relentlessly attempting to destabilise the state of Manipur.” Singh added, “Joined a high-level meeting in presence of A Sharda Devi, President, BJP Manipur Pradesh, Hon’ble Ministers, Hon’ble MLAs, and party karyakartas to deliberate on a stringent approach to deal with elements who are hell-bent upon destabilising Manipur.” A delegation will also be going to Delhi soon to meet the central leaders in this regard, he added. Meanwhile, Manipur Governor Anusuiya Uikey and Chief Minister have extended their greetings to the people of Manipur on New Year 2024 while appealing for a collective effort to restore peace and normalcy in the state. “New Year’s Day is for making new resolutions. As we enter 2024, let us all resolve to work together for creating harmony and perfect peace in all parts of Manipur during the coming year,” the governor said in her message. She said unfortunately, Manipur has been passing through a difficult situation for the last more than seven months due to an unprecedented ethnic clash that broke out May 3 last year. Let us all try to resolve this issue collectively to bring normalcy to maintain our age-old tradition of peaceful co-existence, the governor wished. The Chief Minister said that the eight-month-long ethnic violence in the state had disrupted the fabric of peaceful co-existence among different communities while development works and economic activities slowed down and it was not a good sign for the state. The Chief Minister, in his New Year’s message, said that for nearly eight months now, Manipur has been going through one of the worst phases in its history, with the loss of many precious lives and many others uprooted from their homes. “The unprecedented ethnic conflict has, directly or indirectly, affected everyone residing in the state. It is high time that we rise together to overcome the barriers and stumbling blocks in our journey towards a better Manipur, where all its people live together peacefully, and harmoniously and get access to the facilities of a developed state,” Singh said.

He responded by bucking up at the linebacker position and signing Tremaine Edmunds ($72 million, four years) and T.J. Edwards ($19.5 million, three years) and adding nose tackle Andrew Billings to a $2.75 million, one-year contract. The improvements have been striking. Entering Week 17, the Bears (6-9) are No. 1 in the NFL against the run, allowing 80.7 yards per game, nearly 77 yards better than last year’s defense. With games against the Atlanta Falcons (eighth in the league in rushing offense) and Green Bay Packers remaining, Eberflus’ team is in a position to rank with the best in club history. 2018: 80.0 yards per game 2023: 80.7 yards per game 2001: 82.1 yards per game 1985: 82.4 yards per game “Wow,” Edmunds said when presented with the statistics. “I didn’t know that. It would mean a lot.” Finding help at linebacker was an obvious goal for Poles after trading Roquan Smith last year. Adding Billings on a bargain deal proved shrewd and the former 3-4 nose tackle, slimmed down a little to 311 pounds for the scheme, already earned an $8 million, two-year extension. “They expected me to come in here and make an impact, to be that rock in the middle of the defense,” Billings said. “They wanted to improve the run D and they stressed that to me.” The run defense got even better with the Oct. 31 trade for end Montez Sweat, who has made an impact with six sacks and 13 quarterback hits in seven games. Sweat has been as advertised since arriving, as former Washington Commanders pro scout Donnie Warren said he was a tremendous two-way player — meaning he’s just as good defending the run as he is harassing quarterbacks. It’s eye-opening that the defense could be catapulted from near the bottom of the league to the top with four new players who have a combined total of two Pro Bowl selections — both by Edmunds. “It’s a want-to,” tackle Justin Jones said. “There is no secret recipe to it. You’ve got to want to beat the man in front of you. That’s kind of how I see it. We had a bunch of guys that take pride in that and then obviously bringing (Sweat) in, having him settling into our foundational stuff we do, obviously stop the run first, and then get the quarterback, it’s fun to see.” The Bears have started reaping the benefits that come with stopping the run on first and second down and putting opposing offenses behind the chains. They rank second in the NFL with 18 interceptions — only the San Francisco 49ers (19) have more. They’ve allowed 558 yards rushing on first-and-10, the second-lowest total in the league. They’ve become a good pass-rushing unit since Sweat arrived, with 17 sacks and 49 QB hits in seven games. “There are a lot of things, and I hate to get on the negative side, that we’re still trying to improve on,” Edmunds said. “I’m not going to neglect the fact that would mean a lot to us (to set a franchise record). It shows the hard work guys have put in. We’re not satisfied where we are and I think the main message now is to continue to get better. ” There are some basic metrics the Bears want to improve. They’re tied for 21st in scoring, allowing 21.0 points per game. The Bears are 12th in yardage (318.1), 29th on third down (43.8%), 32nd in the red zone (72.5%) and with the midseason start in getting after quarterbacks they’re 31st in sack rate (4.89%). At Halas Hall, the team has to believe that with some offseason moves and Sweat in place for the start of 2024, they will be better across the board. The Bears are tied for fourth in the league in explosive plays allowed, defined as 20 yards for a passing play and 10 for rushing plays, and that’s significant. Any more, defensive coaches are more concerned with eliminating big plays than they are with stopping the run. The Bears have excelled in both areas and the success against the run, assuming it can be carried into next season, suggests other improvements will follow. “First things first, to be a good defense you’ve got to stop the run,” said Edwards, who is seventh in the league with 141 tackles. “That’s really our goal and was a heavy point of emphasis coming into this year. It’s not always been perfect or anything like that. We’re not worried about the stats right now. We just want to play good team defense. That starts up front and that starts with how you defend the run and try to make opponents as one-dimensional as you can.” The ability to get an opponent behind the sticks is going to lead to more pass-rushing situations and with that, in theory, should come more opportunities for takeaways. The ability to stop the run without loading the box is also paramount because that can leave passing windows open on the back end. “Facts,” Jones said. Yes, the dominant run defenses the Bears have had in the past were all part of very successful teams in the franchise’s rich history. The current group has to look at this development as a steppingstone. “It’s cool,” Jones said. “You want to win more with it.” ()",https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/01/01/column-how-does-this-chicago-bears-run-defense-match-up-with-dominant-teams-of-the-past-the-numbers-dont-lie-2/,https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/202312290716TMS_____MNGTRPUB_SPORTS-COLUMN-HOW-DOES-THIS-CHICAGO-BEARS-3-TB5.jpg?w=1024,2024-01-01 13:38:12,Tribune News Service,['Tribune News Service'],en,us,0.153

175618123,Arrests in Germany over 'Cologne cathedral attack plot',"German police arrested three people on Sunday over an alleged attack plot targeting the cathedral in Cologne on New Year's Eve. The ""alleged means of attack"" is a car, said police in the western city, adding that security measures have been stepped up around the site. The three suspects are believed to be linked to a Tajik who was arrested on Christmas Eve, said Cologne police chief Johannes Hermann. The Tajik was detained by German police on the same day as Austria announced the arrests of another three suspects in Vienna. Bild daily had reported then that the four are all Tajiks who allegedly wanted to carry out attacks for Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), an IS offshoot in Afghanistan. ""Islamist people and groups"" are ""more active than ever at the moment,"" warned Herbert Reul, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, where Cologne is located. Investigations following the Tajik's arrest a week back had found that there is a plot to deploy a car as a means of attack, but ""in which way is not known to us,"" said Frank Wissbaum of Cologne police. Officers had deployed sniffer dogs to search the underground parking of the cathedral for explosives but they have not yet turned up anything suspicious. Nevertheless, protective measures have been significantly stepped up, with around 1,000 police officers deployed since this afternoon to ""protect the cathedral and the population in Cologne city center"". Reul voiced confidence that New Year's festivities can go ahead. ""I think that people can celebrate calmly in Cologne today,"" he said. - Germany on high alert - Germany has been on high alert in recent weeks over possible Islamist attacks, with the country's domestic intelligence chief warning in late November that the risk of such assaults is ""real and higher than it has been for a long time"" because of the Israel-Hamas war. The deadliest attack by Islamist extremists in Germany was carried out by an IS supporter who rammed a truck into a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, killing 12 people. Germany issued a ban on Hamas activities and organisations linked to the group in the wake of the militants' attack on Israel that killed around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Hamas militants also took some 250 hostages, of whom at least 129 are believed to still be held in Gaza. In retaliation for the deadliest attack in its history, Israel announced it would destroy Hamas and began a relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip before a ground offensive there. Gaza's Hamas government says the death toll in the Palestinian territory had reached 21,822, mostly women and children.",https://www.rawstory.com/arrests-in-germany-over-cologne-cathedral-plot/,https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/german-police-have-arrested-three-people-on-over-an-alleged-attack-plot-targeting-the-cathedral-in-cologne-on-new-year-s-eve-in.png?id=50968813&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C126%2C0%2C0,2024-01-01 13:40:51,"Agence France, Agence France-Presse","['Agence France', 'Agence France-Presse']",en,us,-0.083
175575645,Deadline for PGA Tour’s crucial talks with Saudi Public Investment Fund pushed back,"Negotiations between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) have been extended beyond the original deadline of 31 December. A Framework Agreement between the organisations, which stunned the world of men’s professional golf, was announced on 6 June and was initially intended to be concluded before the end of 2023. Discussions have been complicated by the emergence of interest from private equity groups, with the PGA Tour announcing on 10 December that it was in discussions with Strategic Sports Group (SSG), an investment group headlined by Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group. In a memo to players sent on 31 December, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said “meaningful progress” had been made with SSG and “productive conversations” continued with the DP World Tour and the PIF, which bankrolls the breakaway LIV Golf circuit. “I wanted to provide an update on our negotiations with Strategic Sports Group (SSG), the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and DP World Tour,” Monahan wrote. “As you know, the [PGA Tour policy] Board unanimously directed management to pursue exclusive negotiations with SSG. “I am pleased to report that we have made meaningful progress and have provided SSG with the due diligence information they requested.” He continued: “As we move forward in our discussions, we are focused on the finalisation of terms and drafts of necessary documents. We also continue our active and productive conversations with PIF and the DP World Tour. “While we had initially set a deadline of December 31, 2023, to reach an agreement, we are working to extend our negotiations into next year based on the progress we have made to date. “Our goal for 2024 is to reach agreements with SSG, PIF and the DP World Tour, bringing them on board as minority co-investors in PGA Tour Enterprises. These partnerships will allow us to unify, innovate and invest in the game for the benefit of players, fans and sponsors.” LIV Golf secured a major coup with the signing of Masters champion Jon Rahm on a multi-million pound deal earlier this month, despite the world number three having previously insisted he was not interested in jumping ship.",https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/pga-tour-saudi-arabia-public-investment-fund-b2471769.html,https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/09/16/PGA_Tour_Monahan_Golf_10622.jpg?width=1200,2024-01-01 13:41:29,Phil Casey,['Phil Casey'],en,gb,0.17

175601455,What the Red Arrows are doing this winter - ahead of exciting summer events,"They are one of the iconic sights of summer, but what do the Red Arrows get up to during the winter months? The popular aerobatic team, based at RAF Waddington, delighted spectators at air shows and events up and down the country between June and October last year. Now, the team are preparing for the next summer season, with training already under way. Flight Lieutenant Patrick Kershaw, who goes by the call sign Red 9, told our sister site Lincolnshire Live about the hard work now going on. ""Winter training tends to start in October, but it depends what we're doing. For instance, last year we toured the Middle East and departed the last day of October and were away until early December, so winter training didn't really start until the new year,"" he said. READ MORE: Life in and around Grimsby in 1984 captured in 21 brilliant pictures The ghost railway stations of northern Lincolnshire ""This year we've got our new team leader, Jon Bond, who has come back after leaving the team a couple of years ago, and we've got three new pilots as well. They started working [in mid-October] because we're building back to a nine ship [of planes] from an eight ship, and previously we were a seven. It's a kind of building block approach to everything. ""We tend to work in two different sections – the front section, which is 'Enid' and the back section, which is 'Hanna'. Enid starts as three aircraft and, once Red 1 [the leader] is happy, he adds Red 4 and 5 and they start to do manoeuvring and learn parts of the show."" Performing such intricate displays at close quarters requires a great deal of practise as well as skill. ""You start to learn the muscle memory of getting the skills engrained into your routine, so that every time you do it you keep it exactly the same,"" said Flt Lt Kershaw. ""For the back section, we start with Red 7, who starts to learn all the synchro opposition pass manoeuvre parameters and is mentored by Red 6. ""Once they're happy they'll start to work together, and once Red 6 is happy, he'll put myself and Red 8 into that formation to start building up. We'll do that over the course of the first few months and gradually Red 1 and Red 6 will bring that all together and start making the front section bigger. ""We'll then look to fly our first 'nine ship' around the end of February or early March time. The weather can play a massive part in the training, but it's all built into the plan so we expect to lose a few days here and there."" The Red Arrows are coming into their 60th season, having flown around 5,000 displays in 57 countries since 1964. Flying distinctive Hawk jets, the team is made up of pilots, engineers and essential support staff, with frontline, operational experience. In the spring, the team will head overseas for more training before the beginning of the 2024 season. Fans in North East Lincolnshire will be keeping their fingers crossed that the team will take part in the fly-pasts for Cleethorpes Armed Forces Weekend, with organisers expected to find out if an application has been successful in February or March. Speaking about the 2024 season, Flt Lt Kershaw said: ""I'm really excited for it. We train until the end of March and then we go away to Croatia and Greece for some training before coming back at the end of May. We then start the UK display season again. ""It will be our 60th display season so it's a big anniversary for ourselves. We're also back to a nine so we're building the team back and will be there with our trademark diamond nine over the UK.""",https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/what-red-arrows-doing-winter-9006633,https://i2-prod.hulldailymail.co.uk/incoming/article9006781.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/36459256_2018-07-02_Armed-Forces-weekend-2018-in-_ma.jpg,2024-01-01 13:45:11,"Joe Griffin, Paul Johnson","['Joe Griffin', 'Paul Johnson']",en,gb,0.042
175621469,"Cancer checks, A&E waiting times, hospital Covid infections and drug deaths – Why England’s health statistics are even worse than we were told – Talking-up Scotland","Thanks again to Dottie’s Phone for alerting me to this. All sources below. Yesterday in the Guardian: NHS figures that show more people than ever are being checked for cancer have been criticised as “misleading” by experts. Official data published on Monday reported that almost 3 million people in England were tested for cancer in 2022, a 133% increase in the decade since 2013. The latest monthly figures also show that October 2023 was the highest month on record for cancer checks, with 269,492 urgent referrals. But leading cancer experts dismissed the figures as “misleading” and “smoke and mirrors”, noting that the NHS was failing to meet every cancer target by significant margins. The October data shows that the proportion of cancer patients who waited less than two months for their first treatment after an urgent referral was 58.2%, well below the target of 85%. The equivalent figure for NHS Scotland, within 62 days, was 72%, 24% better, meaning thousands more in Scotland treated on time and hundreds of thousands in England not treated on time. A&E waiting times In August 2023, NHS Scotland’s full A&E departments were 14% faster for the 4 hour target and, shockingly, 3 times as many waited more than12 hours in England. However, the gaps are almost certainly wider. On the 4 hour wait, England has the dubious practice of restarting the clock after patients are admitted whereas in Scotland counting continues from first arrival. See this: On the 12 hour wait, this figure too was based on restarting the clock after decision to admit and not, as in Scotland, on the patient’s first arrival in A&E, until the Royal College of Emergency Medicine exposed the practice in February 2023. Hospital Covid infections Throughout the pandemic, Public Health Scotland reported weekly on hospital onset Covid infections allowing BBC Scotland the opportunity to report increases but also to ignore falls. Comparisons with England were not possible as such reporting was not required there. However, some academic research studies did allow a dramatic comparison with between 18% and 23% infection levels in England’s hospitals and only around 1% in Scotland’s hospitals. Drug deaths Scotland’s media and opposition politicians just love drug deaths and are doing their best to ignore the falling trend, 21% down in the last year. However, the comparison with England has been exposed by the UK Civil Service as deeply flawed due to a massive under-reporting of the presence of substances on death certificates by a ratio of 25.1% in England & Wales to only 1.9% in Scotland. Finally: There’s a wider message here. After decades of privatisation under the Tories and of managerialism under New Labour, England’s public service leaders cannot be trusted, motivated as they are by the need to present only positive results to those who agree their salaries and bonuses.

175579015,Nepalese man drowns while swimming off one of Hong Kong’s outlying islands,"A 46-year old man is believed to have drowned on Monday off a Hong Kong outlying island where he went for a drug treatment programme, the Post has learned The Nepalese man, a Hong Kong resident, had gone swimming with other people from Shek Kwu Chau Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre around 12.30pm on Monday, according to a source familiar with the situation. The swim had been arranged and supervised by staff at the drug rehabilitation centre, where the victim went for voluntary treatment, the source added. About 10 minutes into the swim, another man who joined the activity found the victim, surnamed Gurung, floating on the water and unresponsive, the source said.

Hong Kong sport fisherman arrested over death of fellow angler Marine police and a Government Flying Service helicopter were dispatched to the scene. The man was airlifted by helicopter to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Chai Wan, where he was pronounced dead at around 2pm. Police said he was believed to have drowned. Officers said they were still determining whether the death was “suspicious” and warranted further investigation, the source said, adding that CCTV cameras had captured the incident.

175576385,Gangster Goldy Brar declared designated terrrorist under UAPA: What this means,"Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, was declared a designated terrorist by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) on Monday (January 1). Amendments introduced in 2019 brought in provisions by which the Centre can declare individuals — not only organisations — as designated terrorists. Here is how this works. Who is a “terrorist”? The words “terror” or “terrorist” are not defined, but the UAPA defines a “terrorist act” as any act committed with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security, economic security, or sovereignty of India or with intent to strike terror or likely to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country. While the original Act dealt with “unlawful” acts related to secession; anti-terror provisions were introduced in 2004. The 2019 Bill sought to empower the central government to designate an individual a “terrorist” if they are found committing, preparing for, promoting, or involved in an act of terror. A similar provision already existed in Part 4 and 6 of the legislation for organisations that can be designated as a “terrorist organisation”. Home Minister Amit Shah, during a debate on the Bill in Lok Sabha, stressed on the need to designate individuals as terrorists to root out terrorism. How are individuals declared terrorists? The central government may designate an individual as a terrorist through a notification in the official gazette, and add his name to the Fourth Schedule to the UAPA. The government is not required to give an individual an opportunity to be heard before such a designation. At present, in line with the legal presumption of an individual being innocent until proven guilty, an individual who is convicted in a terror case is legally referred to as a terrorist, while those suspected of being involved in terrorist activities are referred to as terror accused. The 2019 amendment did not clarify the standard of proof required to establish that an individual is involved, or is likely to be involved, in terrorist activities. What happens when an individual is declared a terrorist? The designation of an individual as a global terrorist by the United Nations is associated with sanctions including travel bans, freezing of assets and an embargo against procuring arms. The 2019 amendment, however, did not provide any such detail. The amendment also gave the Centre the power to remove a name from the schedule when an individual makes an application. If an application filed by an individual declared a terrorist is rejected by the government, they have the right to seek a review within one month after the application is rejected. Under the amendment, the central government set up a review committee comprising a chairperson (a retired or sitting judge of a High Court) and three other members. The review committee will be empowered to order the government to delete the name of the individual from the schedule that lists “terrorists”, if it considers the order to be flawed. Apart from these two avenues, the individual can also move the courts challenging the government’s order.

175578907,AHI Internship Program Concludes Its 2023 Fall Session,"WASHINGTON, DC – The 2023 fall session of the American Hellenic Institute (AHI) Internship Program has officially concluded. For four decades, over 200 students and recent graduates have completed the program at AHI’s Hellenic House building, located just five blocks from the White House in Washington DC. The internship program enriches policy knowledge, supports career aspirations, and helps create strong relationships with professionals and academics, allowing for a first-hand experience of how foreign policy is created and executed in our nation’s capital. Interns work directly with staff members on various activities, including performing research and analysis, drafting letters, facilitating events, and assisting with other project-oriented tasks. They also attend lectures held at think tanks, monitor legislation and congressional hearings on Capitol Hill, draft press releases, and perform administrative duties. Anna Maria Papadopoulos and Clara Flanders took full advantage of their time as AHI interns. Previously, Anna Maria participated in the 15th annual AHIF Foreign Policy Trip to Greece and Cyprus. “I would like to thank Anna Maria and Clara for their invaluable work and contributions to AHI on multiple fronts,” AHI President Nick Larigakis said. “Educating students in the field of public policy and government is vital. They have a bright future, and we look forward to seeing their many accomplishments.” Anna Maria Papadopoulos is a senior and a Dean’s List recipient at American University, where she is majoring in Legal Studies as part of a rigorous Politics, Policy, and Law Program and the Leadership Program within the School of Public Affairs. Papadopoulos moved from Thessaloniki, Greece, two years ago with one goal; to become an advocate for her Greek-American community by achieving a well-rounded academic background and gaining experience in the political arena. Her dedication to foreign affairs advanced through her internship on Capitol Hill. While interning on the Hill, she became familiar with foreign affairs policy by attending hearings, drafting memos, and assisting with legislative research on matters of diplomacy and national defense. On campus, Papadopoulos is president of the American University Hellenic Student Association and a proud member of the AU Diplomats club, where she mentors newly admitted Greek and Cypriot students and provides a resource to facilitate their transition in the community. Moreover, this summer Papadopoulos participated in the 15th annual American Hellenic Institute Foundation Foreign Policy College Student Trip to Greece and Cyprus. Clara Flanders is a Senior and Dean’s List student at American University where she is majoring in an Interdisciplinary Studies degree of Communications, Legal Institutions, Economics, and Government. She is the recipient of the highly selective Presidential Scholarship and part of the rigorous three year Politics, Policy and Law Scholars Program at American University’s School of Public Affairs. Flanders’ interest in foreign affairs was bolstered by her study abroad experience in Brussels, Belgium, where she learned about the responsibilities of the EU and talked directly with representatives from Greece and Cyprus like European Parliament elected Member Anna-Michelle Asimakopoulou, concerning pressing geopolitical affairs. Clara also visited Greece and there was able to gain a deeper appreciation for the country and its culture and attain a more complex understanding of and interest in Greek foreign relations, specifically its diplomatic connections with the U.S. AHI offers internship positions throughout the year. The internship is an excellent opportunity for those interested in gaining experience in government affairs and foreign policy issues, specifically U.S. relations with Greece and Cyprus. It is designed for undergraduate students, graduate students, and recent graduates, and helps them explore new career avenues and jump-start professions in government, journalism, lobbying, or the nonprofit sector.

175581003,How anaerobic digestion can benefit and challenge Irish farmers,"As we await publication of the government’s National Biomethane Strategy, Ireland is playing catch-up with other countries when it comes to the large scale rollout of anaerobic digestion (AD) technology. Under the Climate Action Plan, there is a target to expand the production of agri-centric biomethane to 5.7TWh/annum by 2030, which is around 10% of Ireland’s total natural gas demand. This will require the construction of an estimated 150 to 200 AD plants around the country, a significant increase on the 15 facilities currently in operation. If the target is achieved, the emission savings would amount to almost two million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent annually. The production of indigenous biomethane is seen as playing a key role in reducing emissions from the agriculture sector. Anaerobic digestion Anaerobic digestion (AD) takes place when organic material decays or is broken down by bacteria and enzymes in the absence of oxygen. When this is carried out in a controlled environment of airtight tanks, covered lagoons or covered ponds, this is known as a biogas plant or AD plant. The organic matter is released as biogas; this is a mixture of the combustible gas methane (50-75%), carbon dioxide (25-45%), small amounts of water (2-7%) and trace gases. The type of feedstock used by anaerobic digesters can include pig or cattle slurry; food waste; energy crops (grass silage, maize-silage, grain); municipal solid waste from households and organic solid waste from industry. The biogas produced can be “upgraded” to biomethane and injected into the gas network or used as a vehicle fuel. Across Europe, where AD technology has been used since the 1970s, the gas is normally used on site to generate heat and electricity in a combined heat and power–unit (CHP). Renewable technology Although Ireland has developed other renewable technologies such as wind, solar and ordinary biomass, there has been no support mechanism introduced yet to make anaerobic digestion a reality in this country. “For any renewable technology to evolve or to emerge, it needs some level of support to get it off the ground and this would be evident right across Europe,” Barry Caslin, energy and rural development specialist with Teagasc, told Agriland. “It’s not for the faint hearted to be getting involved in the AD process, it can be quite expensive going down the whole planning route, there’s different interpretations in different local authorities. “There can be a lot of local opposition that you may have to deal with in some areas as well. So getting a project off the ground, there’s a long lead-in process,” he added. There can also be very high costs associated with connecting an AD plant to the grid. Caslin has a level of trepidation when it comes to Ireland meeting its biomethane targets as “there is a consideration amount of ground to cover” between now and the end of the decade. “When I think about all of these projects that are in incubation at the moment and realising all the challenges that these people have in getting the projects off the ground, it does seem a bit unrealistic achieving the 5.7TWh/annum target by 2030,” he said. One of the major hurdles in developing an AD plant will be financing, Caslin estimated that the 200 AD plants could cost in the region of €10 billion. “In order for people to invest in AD as a technology, they need to see that there’s policy around this whole area, and they need to see that there’s government commitment in this area,” he said. Caslin said that many investors are awaiting the details of the National Biomethane Strategy which is due to be published “fairly soon” after being worked on over the past number of years. He stressed that the document is a strategy and not a support scheme for the AD sector. Opportunities and challenges Along with helping in the transition away from fossil fuels and promoting a circular economy, AD technology offers opportunities for Irish farmers. The income generated from selling biomass, mainly grass silage, to an AD biogas plant will provide additional income streams for farm families in rural Ireland and provide a land use alternative. “We’ve got over 80,000 beef and sheep farmers in this country who make a very low gross margin per hectare who would look at this area as a potential area to give them a diversification opportunity,” Caslin said. The residue or digestate of the AD process can be separated into a liquid and fibrous fraction. The liquid can be returned to the land as a high-value fertiliser and the solid fibre used as a soil conditioner. The fermentation improves the quality of manure as nutrients are more available for plants and pathogens and weed seeds are killed through the AD process. Teagasc estimates that a total land area of 120,000ha, which is less than 3% of available land, will be needed to produce the silage to feed the AD biomethane plants. In addition, winter slurry from 1.3 million cattle will be required which represents approximately one fifth of all winter cattle slurry produced in Ireland. The land requirements could result in displacement of livestock or existing tillage production. Caslin said that livestock displacement could be mitigated against by improving grass management and utilisation on farms. “There will be challenges in mobilising the slurry together with possible resentment towards the technology in areas where grass availability for lease or conacre is in limited supply,” he said. Ireland currently imports over 70% of our energy requirements, which can be impacted by geopolitical events, as has been particularly evident in recent times. “As a nation we need to look at what is the best use of our land. Should we be using it all for food production or should we be also insulating ourselves on the side of our energy requirements going forward, which makes us more attractive in terms of foreign direct investment as well,” Caslin said.",https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/how-anaerobic-digestion-can-benefit-and-challenge-irish-farmers/,https://cdn.agriland.ie/uploads/2022/05/biogas-gf9739c160_1920.jpg,2024-01-01 14:00:00,Aisling O'Brien,"[""Aisling O'Brien""]",en,ie,0.008
175586439,Sun-Times reporter steps back while still rooting for those who carry on,"Just as with other life lessons, it took me too long to grasp this one: I’m one lucky guy. But it’s undeniable. The seeming serendipity of birth dropped me into a free land that can be great enough to rectify its problems. I had two loving, supportive parents who never went to college but encouraged an education. Let’s face it, being a white male helped, too. The journalism bug bit me when I was young and never let go. Out of it grew interest in politics and civic affairs. I covered Chicago’s City Hall for the Southtown Economist, later called the Daily Southtown, during the raucous Council Wars. And I revered the Sun-Times, with its brilliant columnists and bold investigations. It was where I wanted to be. The City Hall work drew me to business issues, first by absorbing the immense power government has through zoning and other regulations to make or break fortunes. It’s no wonder so many alderpersons have gone to the clink for trying to get a cut. It’s hard to believe now, but in the 1980s and ‘90s, journalism was financially healthy and the job market was intensely competitive. I had a couple of stopovers after the Southtown — very important as it turned out — and landed at the Sun-Times in 1996. The editors gave me wide leeway from the start and a column after a couple years. I was that rare person doing exactly what he wanted where he wanted it. I’ve called it luck, but that doesn’t do it justice. My blessings include a dear and wise wife and two children who have grown into hard-working, caring adults. With this new year, I’m ending my full-time schedule at the Sun-Times and this weekly Chicago Enterprise column, which I’ve tried to craft as a diary of the city’s changing economy. I’ll be retiring but offering occasional pieces as a “contributor at large,” which suggests I’m either an escapee or larger in the waistline because working from home means easy access to the kitchen. It’ll be the second time I’ve left my dream job. The first was in 2013. The Sun-Times now has positive, stable ownership as a nonprofit. But 10 years ago, the Sun-Times owner was destructive. He would later sell his newspaper holdings and lower his public profile following “me too” allegations. I left the paper to work for then-Gov. Pat Quinn for a couple years promoting job growth. That ended with a change in administrations. The Chicago News Guild, the union for editorial workers at the Sun-Times, asked me to help. Job No. 1 was to hunt for better owners for the Sun-Times itself. The paper was destined to be merged into the Chicago Tribune, which Craig Rosenbaum, the News Guild’s executive director, and I knew would mean the end. With his legal chops, Rosenbaum worked the antitrust angle, and I worked business and civic contacts. We later talked about how it seemed we both were supposed to be there at that given time. It was like being a matchmaker, putting people together in a room to see if they would click. We got it done, but all credit goes to those who put up the money: unions and the Chicago Federation of Labor, former Ald. Edwin Eisendrath and others at first, followed by private equity executive Michael Sacks and the late Rocky Wirtz. It led to today’s affiliation with Chicago Public Media and WBEZ, with revenue from foundations and readers. The episode proved how organized labor can do more to protect jobs than just strike or enforce contracts. And it struck a blow for competitive news in town. Many Chicagoans don’t realize it because they can access several sources of print or digital news, but journalism as done by humans and not AI is still in a free fall. Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism found that more than half of U.S. counties barely have access to local news, and the nationwide employment of newspaper journalists has fallen by two-thirds, or 43,000 jobs, since 2005. There is no intent here to hold that journalism is more important than any other job. Goodness knows, that’s annoying. We can be myopic and arrogant, even amid our reduced circumstances. But I also know most are intently serious about what they do and examine themselves to a fault. The 3 a.m. panics are common in this work — the ones where you bolt awake to say, “Did I double-check that fact?” or “I forgot to mention that other thing.” It happens a lot. Yet, here I am on my own terms able to anticipate more leisure and less hunching over a laptop. Those so inclined can look up prayers for journalists. The prayers ask for God’s grace that we write with compassion and with courage to confront injustice. I would ask also that those who do this good and sometimes dangerous work be fulfilled and have the comfort of family, friends and a decent standard of living. It’s a lot to ask, but divine help and a fighting spirit moves mountains.",https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/1/24018805/roeder-business-reporter-steps-back-rooting-chicago-suntimes-staff,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eeadbb7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1142+0+134/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FEu_IfVPxiGUKGe2bfywVh9S68ts%3D%2F0x0%3A2000x1276%2F2000x1276%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281003,2024-01-01 14:00:00,David Roeder,['David Roeder'],en,us,0.094
175582467,Arrests In Germany Over &#8216;Cologne Cathedral Attack Plot&#8217;,"German police arrested three people on Sunday over an alleged attack plot targeting the cathedral in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. The “alleged means of attack” is a car, said police in the western city, adding that security measures have been stepped up around the site. The three suspects are believed to be linked to a Tajik who was arrested on Christmas Eve, said Cologne police chief Johannes Hermann. The Tajik was detained by German police on the same day as Austria announced the arrests of another three suspects in Vienna. Bild daily had reported then that the four are all Tajiks who allegedly wanted to carry out attacks for Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), an IS offshoot in Afghanistan. “Islamist people and groups” are “more active than ever at the moment,” warned Herbert Reul, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, where Cologne is located. Investigations following the Tajik’s arrest a week back had found that there is a plot to deploy a car as a means of attack, but “in which way is not known to us,” said Frank Wissbaum of Cologne police. Officers had deployed sniffer dogs to search the underground parking of the cathedral for explosives but they have not yet turned up anything suspicious. Nevertheless, protective measures have been significantly stepped up, with around 1,000 police officers deployed since this afternoon to “protect the cathedral and the population in Cologne city center”. Reul voiced confidence that New Year’s festivities can go ahead. “I think that people can celebrate calmly in Cologne today,” he said. Germany on high alert – Germany has been on high alert in recent weeks over possible Islamist attacks, with the country’s domestic intelligence chief warning in late November that the risk of such assaults is “real and higher than it has been for a long time” because of the Israel-Hamas war. The deadliest attack by Islamist extremists in Germany was carried out by an IS supporter who rammed a truck into a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, killing 12 people. Germany issued a ban on Hamas activities and organisations linked to the group in the wake of the militants’ attack on Israel that killed around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Hamas militants also took some 250 hostages, of whom at least 129 are believed to still be held in Gaza. In retaliation for the deadliest attack in its history, Israel announced it would destroy Hamas and began a relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip before a ground offensive there. Gaza’s Hamas government says the death toll in the Palestinian territory had reached 21,822, mostly women and children.",https://independent.ng/arrests-in-germany-over-cologne-cathedral-attack-plot/,https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Daily-Independent-3.jpg,2024-01-01 14:00:02,Akin Yusuf,['Akin Yusuf'],en,ng,-0.083
175577659,"In the Peruvian Andes, the new year is welcomed with a punch-up, then a hug","The fighting begins and ends with a hug, part of a singular ritual that has residents of the Peruvian Andes punching and kicking in a year-end fight competition known as Takanakuy. Before the duelling starts in an open-air arena, male fighters remove their elaborate headgear – stuffed birds, foxes or even goat heads worn as symbols of strength or to bring good luck. Many participants in the holiday tradition come from the town of San Juan de Lurigancho in Chumbivilcas province, part of the Cusco department southeast of Peruvian capital Lima. The atmosphere is more celebratory than grim. Wearing traditional costumes or leather jackets and boots, men and women join to do the Huaylia, a traditional Andean dance. The party, however, will end in a fight. It’s all part of the Takanakuy, a Quechua-language word that means “to hit each other”. The tradition, which dates to Spanish colonial times, evolved over the centuries to become a means of settling accounts between neighbours in areas where there was no authority. Before, the fights were “about land disputes, and this was the way to resolve problems between families, between neighbours”, said 33-year-old hairdresser and fighter Froilan Rosas. Some people fight to defend personal or family honour. Takanakuy takes place every December 25 in the Peruvian regions of Cusco, Apurimac, Huancavelica and Arequipa, as well as in the Bolivian Andes. Some regions stage a variation: the women-only Warmi Takanakuy. The goal is to end the year in peace, residents say. The party pauses, and the fighting begins. A fighter challenges another by calling out his or her first and last name. The person challenged is free to refuse, and may offer a substitute. Before stepping into the ring, male fighters – some shirtless – bind their hands with cloth and swap their shoes for boots. In this club, duels are brief, lasting no more than a minute, with only punching and kicking allowed. A referee presides over the fight, and four judges decide the winner. “This is a ritual,” said Julio Boza, a burly 72-year-old and one of the organisers. “It starts with a fight and, after fighting, ends with a hug.” Above all, Boza added, “It is a way to resolve everything that we have had in the year. This is the time to resolve it.” On this day there were 10 fights before dozens of fans. Anyone, even foreigners, can join in. One enthusiastic Romanian challenged a local resident. Wearing a Peruvian football T-shirt bearing the name of his idol Paolo Guerrero, he won his bout. Although Takanakuy once was based largely on existing rivalries, today it is more a sport for the young. “We’re boys, so we want to measure our strength, to know how we’re doing,” said Omar Huachaca, 30, a merchant from Cusco. “More than anything, the blood in our veins brings us to the party.”",https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/3246907/peruvian-andes-new-year-welcomed-punch-then-hug,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/01/d196c936-b3f4-4cec-b230-2b6075ec583d_7bae406a.jpg,2024-01-01 14:00:12,Agence France-Presse,['Agence France-Presse'],en,cn,0.554

The presentation was followed by REAL’s 2024 budget request, where members of the board asked the city for five times more than it had in previous years, amounting to more than $5 million. Members of city administration were appointed as interim board members, with city manager Niki Anderson as chair. The decision created a rift between some city councillors.

175577749,Every Premier League team's plan and top target for the January transfer window,"As the calendar turns to 2024, the January transfer window officially opens. The next month marks the last occasion managers can improve their squad before the end of another season. The Premier League always leads the way when it comes to transfer spending and January '24 promises to be no different. With a thrilling title race on the cards, the battle for the top four heating up and the fight for survival including a clutch of teams, all 20 teams need some help for the final months of the campaign. It will take some going to match last January's spending - which set a new record of £815million - but there should be plenty of intriguing deals before the window slams shut at the start of next month. The usual suspects will dominate the headlines, with the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool all likely to strike deals, but Mirror Sport has taken a look at every top-flight club's plan for the next month.... Arsenal - John Cross Arsenal fans are crying out for a new striker - but it is unlikely they will get their wish in January. The problem for Arsenal is that they do not have much scope to do a big deal in next month’s window unless they make a significant sale. Like a few clubs, Arsenal have spent big in recent times and are having to be careful to stay within strict spending rules. It will be a “must sell before we can buy” mandate in the window. That does not mean they will do nothing because they are actively looking and it may be that a defender is their No1 priority with a loan deal very much an option. It is impossible to overstate just what a blow losing Jurrien Timber was at the start of the season. Now Takehiro Tomiyasu has been out and will probably go to the Asia Cup with Japan. That leaves them horribly short in the full back positions. If a deal could be done for a versatile defender then that would be ideal. The fans are crying out for a striker - dare I say it, Ivan Toney - because they want a finisher, a killer who will take chances. But Brentford do not want to sell because of their own issues - losing players to AFCON and a worrying run of bad results - and Arsenal could not do a deal like that unless they sell. Aston Villa - Neil Moxley Unai Emery says he has the backing of his owners at Aston Villa - and knows where he would like to strengthen. But his problem is three-fold: He cannot find what he is looking for. He doesn’t have much money to play with. And he has to find someone prepared to be an understudy to Ollie Watkins. Villa have cover in almost every position - bar keeper Emi Martinez and spearhead Watkins. Injury to either would place significant question marks against a sustained challenge on the top four during the course of the rest of the season. During an entertaining exchange ahead of the clash with Burnley, he was asked specifically about a back-up to Watkins with this reporter. “Tell me names,” he said. Stories are already circulating that Villa can only work with a loan player due to Financial Fair Play regulations which cuts down their options still further. Emery also said: “Last year, we were thinking about a lot of things in January but the most important thing was to reduce the squad. We only added two players - Alex Moreno and Jhon Duran - and we were successful. We are watching everything. But to improve upon our two strikers in the current circumstances, is very, very difficult.” Bournemouth - Ryan Taylor Bournemouth are poised to keep Hamed Traore at the club this winter amid his battle with malaria. Andoni Iraola confirmed on Friday that the 23-year-old attacking midfielder had been hospitalised by the infectious disease having missed the club's past four matches. Traore has been attracting strong interest in recent weeks from both Italy and Spain but he will now miss the Africa Cup of Nations in his homeland, Ivory Coast as he continues his recovery. Sevilla wanted to take Traore on loan until the end of the season while Fiorentina, Lazio, AC Milan and Napoli have also made enquiries. Traore, who arrived from Sassuolo for £21million on deadline day in January, has played just 44 minutes of Premier League action this season and is now set for a prolonged period of absence. Meanwhile, David Brooks is wanted by Championship promotion hopefuls Leeds and Southampton after struggling to nail down a starting berth following his remarkable return to action. Leeds have done their fair share of business with Bournemouth in recent times even though relations were soured when the Cherries snatched Max Aarons from the Whites' clutches last summer. Despite recent speculation, Arsenal are not targeting Bournemouth striker Dominic Solanke, who has 12 Premier League goals to his name this season. Brentford - Ian Winrow Bryan Mbeumo’s injury has only underlined the need for a striker. FC Cincinnati’s US international Brandon Vasquez is a target along with Real Betis’ Spain U21 winger Assane Diao. Toney is sure to dominate headlines as well, but Thomas Frank has been clear that he wants his returning talisman to remain with the club: ""I really, really would like to keep him. As a coach I'd love to have my best players with me all the time. From my perspective, I don't want to sell him because I think he's fantastic."" Brighton - Ian Winrow Roberto De Zerbi wants to add a full-back to his squad with Sevilla’s young right-back Juanlu Sanchez, 20, on the club’s radar. Hoffenheim striker Max Beier has also been linked. “About the transfer market, I explained what we need,"" the Italian boss said last week. “Not only full-back. We need, I think, in three, four positions. “But, at the end, it is the owner, the club, to decide to bring anyone or not. I can say my opinion, I can say my idea, I can explain what we need if we want to compete in this way. Otherwise, we have to accept the different opinion.” Burnley - Dave Anderson Vincent Kompany claims he will not jeopardise Burnley ’s future by spending big in January on Premier League quality. Burnley are in the drop zone and could do with more proven Premier League players to help their young and inexperienced side survive. But the Clarets have a long-term goal to develop these players to make the club sustainable in the top fight and Kompany will not give up on that plan in the hope of staying up this season. “The problem is that final touch in the Premier League, what is that?” said the Burnley boss. “Down the bottom of the league, that’s Dominic Solanke, that’s Raul Jimenez at Fulham. That’s the level we’re talking about that you need for the Premier League. “So to go out in the market and find that level of players for us is very hard. Other than that, I think we have to be realistic. The biggest way for us to progress is to see the progression in the players we have. “But if there’s something smart we can do, we will obviously be open to that. “What we’re discussing at the moment is ‘what if’ moments. What if an offer was to come in for a player, would we be able to do something in the market? What if a player became available on loan, would we be able to do something?” Chelsea - John Cross The biggest story of Chelsea ’s transfer window will undoubtedly be Conor Gallagher and whether they end up selling him. Let’s not kid ourselves here… Gallagher is a hard-working, determined and battling midfielder. He’s not a glamorous, stylish or even goalscoring midfielder. But it is what he represents to Chelsea fans that is important. He is home grown, academy graduate, a Chelsea fan himself and he clearly loves the club. The Chelsea fans perceive he has a greater affection and affinity for the club than some of the many foreign imports that they struggle to relate to. And yet… they could end up selling him in this window. It is about balancing the books after their recent spending sprees. And selling a home grown player gives you more relief in Financial Fair Play terms. Tottenham were keen to insist reports out of Italy - it seems bizarre that they are originating reports about an English domestic deal in Italy - are not accurate that they are in talks with Chelsea about Gallagher. But, clearly, there is interest in Gallagher because he is a super player. Committed, strong and improving. He is nearly always Chelsea’s best player and if he is not then he is in their top three performers. However, Gallagher has 18 months left on his deal, Chelsea have held talks about tying him down and he could yet stay at the club. But will he be at the level they want to get? From what I’ve see, he definitely will. But that’s another part of the issue. Him going or staying is not set in stone but Chelsea must decide whether selling is really worth the inevitable backlash that they would receive for cashing in. The point is it would give them some cash to do deals as well but, in reality, this is not going to be a busy window for Chelsea compared to the last few. Last January, Premier League spending reached a record £830m and Chelsea was a big part of that with big deals, including Enzo Fernandez from Benfica for £105m. They clearly need a new No9 but it is unlikely they will do that in January and they also want to give Nicolas Jackson a chance while Broja may yet also come good and give them what they need in terms of a centre forward’s profile: goals, presence and focal point. Chelsea have had so many injuries this season that maybe their squad does not look so bloated after all and, beyond Gallagher, they have not got lots of players to sell. A new striker is a longer term target so, again, that is unlikely to happen in this window and that is why - Gallagher apart - January could be quiet for Chelsea. Crystal Palace - John Richardson Crystal Palace could treble their money if they listen to offers for their coveted central defenders Mark Guehi and Joachim Anderson. Both arrived at Selhurst Park in the summer of 2021, Guehi for £18 million from Chelsea while Anderson was lured from Lyon for £17 million. Since then Guehi has established himself as an England international and has attracted the interest of his former club Chelsea and Manchester United with Old Trafford boss Erik ten Hag anxious to add some extra defensive stability to a side which is prone to leaking cheap goals. Newcastle lead the clubs on the trail of Danish international Anderson who has linked up well with Guehi at Palace. It’s unlikely that they would be tempted to sell in the January transfer window but next summer could be a different matter. But owner Steve Parish who has already beaten off an August transfer deadline move from Manchester City for Eberechi Eze and kept Michael Olise despite considerable interest, won’t allow either defender to leave unless he receives offers he can’t refuse. In both cases their values have tripled to around £60 million as he attempts to keep the impressive Anglo-Danish double act. Everton - Dave Anderson Everton expect a quiet January after director of football Kevin Thelwell said: “financial prudence is crucial”. The Blues have appealed their 10-point penalty for breaking the Premier League’s FFP rules and are in the middle of a takeover by 777 Partners, making it virtually impossible to do much. Boss Sean Dyche knew he had to redress imbalances in his squad when he took over nearly a year ago and he is more focused on hanging on to his key players. Amadou Onana has been linked with Arsenal, while Jarrad Branthwaite is attracting much interest, and Dyche does not want to lose anyone with the club’s Premier League safety still in the balance. “I knew when I got here the squad was overloaded in certain areas and it had to be skinned down,” he said. ""We knew that both for literal reasons because it was too many bodies and for financial reasons. Finding the balance and correcting that, I think we’ve done that pretty well. “It’s fair to say with such a slim squad we don’t want to be losing players. I don’t think there’s much reality in those situations of people going to be honest. We move forward with the group we’ve got and we believe in the group we’ve got. That’s the biggest thing for me to stay focused on what we’re doing and how we’re working.” Fulham - Alan Smith The window will be defined by whether Joao Palhinha stays or goes. Bayern Munich are expected to renew their interest as Thomas Tuchel craves a central midfielder. And should the Portugal international leave for Bavaria, the Cottagers will be desperate to reinvest in an immediate replacement. They will be looking for £70m for the 28-year-old. Aside from that dilemma, Marco Silva’s team looks badly in need of a centre forward - although that is applicable to half the league. The loss of Aleksandar Mitrovic to Saudi Arabia in the summer has appeared increasingly significant due to a recent dry spell. Watch out too for bids for centre back Tosin Adarabioyo, who is out of contract in the summer and has been a standout performer of late. Liverpool - Dave Anderson Liverpool need a centre-half and a left-back - but Jurgen Klopp claims he is no rush to splash the cash this month. The Reds have done business before in the January transfer window and skipper Virgil van Dijk, Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo were all signed this month. Wolfsburg’s French centre-half Maxence Lacroix is available for around £25million, while the Reds have also been linked with Sporting Lisbon’s Portuguese international Gonçalo Inacio. Liverpool like Crystal Palace’s Marc Guehi, but are expected to wait until the summer when the Eagles are more likely to be willing to sell the England international. Liverpool are short at centre-half after Joel Matip was ruled out for the rest of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, leaving them with just van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and rookie Jarell Quansah. The Reds have no senior left-back after Kostas Tsimikas broke his collarbone against Arsenal to join Andy Robertson on the sidelines. Robertson is due to return this month from his dislocated shoulder, but Jurgen Klopp claims he is still weeks away because the Scotland defender has yet to resume full training with the team. Liverpool have been linked with Fulham’s USA international full-back Antonee Robinson. Liverpool will move in January if they feel there is a danger of missing out on a target and this is why they bought Diaz two years ago from Porto for £37.5million because Tottenham came in for him. Klopp has always talked down January signings to replace injured players and insists the Reds will not deviate from their long-term targets. The Kop boss quashed talk of Liverpool replacing Matip in January and says it is extremely hard to get the right calibre of player. He is also delighted with Quansah in his first season with the senior team and would not want to block the 20-year-old’s progress with a short-term signing. Luton Town - Alan Smith Rob Edwards would love to find another free agent in the mould of Andros Townsend and Ross Barkley because the Hatters do not have much money to spend. But first they should be trying to tie Townsend down to an extension after he initially agreed to a short-term deal. That Luton are in with more than a puncher's chance of staying up - an achievement that would be as remarkable as any in Premier League history - will not see the club gamble by spending their TV money. That is a mistake too many before them have made. The absence of captain Tom Lockyer means Edwards would also desire a new defender but, again, at a knockdown price. Man City - Jeremy Cross It might be that the departure of Kalvin Phillips in the transfer window is the most talked about event to happen at Manchester City. It's been a long time coming – but will feel like an eternity to the man himself. Phillips had the world at his feet when he left Leeds to join City in a £50m deal in 2022. But the move has turned into a living nightmare for the midfielder, who turned down a host of clubs to join City, only to find himself left on the outside looking in. Liverpool were keen on signing him last summer, but Phillips wanted one last crack at breaking into Pep Guardiola's side. Yet nothing has changed. The situation has turned Phillips into a standing joke, because he's started more games for England this year than for his club. Newcastle are expected to rescue him, with the offer of a loan move to St James' Park for the rest of the campaign with a view to making the deal permanent. Guardiola doesn't have the biggest squad in the Premier League, but he has the best one when it comes to quality. Not that the Spaniard ever stops looking for new talent. And the English champions have been keeping close tabs on teenage sensation Claudio Echeverri, who has been labelled the 'next Lionel Messi '. It's understood Etihad bosses have held provisional talks with River Plate, and could strike a deal in the coming weeks for the 17-year-old. City have also been keeping tabs on 19-year-old Brazilian Savinho. He has excelled for Girona this season, where he is on-loan from Troyes. Both clubs are part of the City Football Group, although a deal for City to sign him could be put off until the summer. Man Utd - Jeremy Cross Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a 'to do' list longer than the queues for the sales on London's Oxford Street. But right at the top of it will be to improve Manchester United's recruitment. In the last decade United's approach to signing players has been the equivalent of sticking the tail on the donkey while blindfolded. From a distance, lifelong United fan Ratcliffe has sat back and watched the English giants blow £400m on superstar signings under Erik ten Hag, not to mention close to £2billion in 18 years of the Glazers ownership. And the end result is that Ratcliffe will have to spend next month focusing his energies on offloading those who can't cut the mustard at Old Trafford, rather than lining up new arrivals that will suddenly transform United into title contenders. January is not the time to land your priority targets - no matter how badly you need them through the door. Donny van de Beek (remember him?), is expected to be the first to go, with Eintracht Frankfurst heading a very short shortlist of clubs willing to take him off United's hands. A loan deal for the rest of the season is being discussed for the United outcast and Holland international. Ratcliffe is also keen to broker a deal between Ten Hag and Jadon Sancho. The pair have been at loggerheads for months and there is no winner from the situation. Unless the hatchet can be buried, United will look to send Sancho out on-loan, with a view to the deal becoming permanent. Or even use him as a makeweight in a deal to bring someone in the opposite direction. How has it come to this for someone who cost the club almost £80m not too long ago? United will look to get rid of fringe players, the most high-profile being Anthony Martial, who is out of contract at the end of this season. Raphael Varane and Casemiro could also be allowed to find new clubs if the terms are right, because both of them are not expected to agree to wage cuts in the summer. FFP restrictions means Ratcliffe's hands a somewhat tied for the time being, so don't expect any fanfare or red carpets to be rolled out in the New Year. Newcastle - Simon Bird One big issue that could infuriate rivals: will Newcastle flog unwanted players to Saudi Arabian clubs owned by their owners the PIF? And will they use the four Saudi Pro League clubs in their ownership stable to loan good players, and therefore avoiding big transfer fees? Newcastle will not be panic buying in January but they need squad upgrades to maintain their rise into the top seven. In the next 12 months Eddie Howe needs upgrades in the right wing and No.6 positions and a robust striker. In the short term, Manchester City and England midfielder Kalvin Phillips is a top target on loan but even that could cost up to £7m. They could decide to loan a keeper too, with Arsenal’s Aaron Ramsdale needing first team football, and David De Gea out of contract. But getting knocked out of Europe and the Carabao Cup means the demands on Eddie Howe’s squad in the second half of the season have been reduced. They hope for a long FA Cup run and to qualify for Europe, and have players due to return from injury. Last summer’s transfer business is coming under scrutiny. They signed a £54m midfielder in Sandro Tonali, without knowing he has a gambling problem that led to him being banned until the end of August. Committing to spend £28m on teenager Lewis Hall on July 1 also looks questionable in the short term, when ready made players were needed. The uncertainty over Dan Ashworth, courted by Manchester United, remains until the Old Trafford giants appoint a new director of football. Nottingham Forest - Neil Moxley Forest’s management were wary of sacking Steve Cooper during December. They found a replacement in Nuno Espirito Santo and will be hoping the manager’s close ties to Jorge Mendes come in handy. The super-agent was responsible for the conveyor-belt of talent that helped Wolves not only into the Premier League but also into the last eight of the Europa League. That tie-up proved crucial to Nuno during his time at Molineux and if players become available of the ilk of Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves - both signed by Nuno at Wolves - then no-one at the City Ground will be complaining. An interesting one to keep an eye out for, however, despite keeper Matt Turner’s heroics against Manchester United is a return for Keylor Navas. Neither Turner, not Odysseas Vlachodimos have truly impressed. The Costa Rica is kicking his heels at Paris St. Germain and helped Forest no end last term when he arrived on a similar loan deal until the end of the season. Sheffield United - Ian Winrow Kasper Schmeichel, 37, has been linked with a move to Bramall Lane with Blades boss Chris Wilder keen to bring in competition for Wes Foderingham. Schmeichel is currently with Belgian club Anderlecht. Wilder has made it clear that any players that do arrive this month, will do so with the remit of instantly improving their squad. ""These players have got to go into the first team,"" he explained. ""There are going to be players who are surplus to requirements who may feel a little bit hard done by, and may not have had the opportunities that others have had. But you've got to make quick decisions and gut reactions and feelings in terms of what you want it to look like and what you want the team to look like."" Tottenham - Ryan Taylor Tottenham are ready to pay £25million for 21-year-old Genoa central defender Radu Dragusin after talks with Nice over Jean-Clair Todibo hit the rocks. Spurs had also held positive discussions with the Frenchman's entourage but Nice aren't keen on selling mid-season which could prompt a frustrating drawn out winter transfer saga. But Ange Postecoglou wants a new centre-back through the door as soon as next week and Tottenham have now switched attention to Romanian international Dragusin. There has also been interest from Newcastle, AC Milan, Napoli and Atalanta but Spurs are at the front of the queue as Dragusin has already given the move his seal of approval. Tottenham are yet to contact Chelsea over a deal for Conor Gallagher despite suggestions the two clubs had entered talks over a shock transfer. Chelsea will listen to offers ahead of next month's window as Gallagher is approaching the final 18 months of his deal but the England international is valued at £50m. The 23-year-old played the entirety of Chelsea's 3-2 triumph at Luton Town and while he remains a player of admiration to Spurs, they're yet to make their move. Postecoglou will be left light on the ground in midfield next month when Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr head to the Africa Cup of Nations. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's future is also up for debate but the Dane will only be allowed to leave Spurs at the right price and if they can land a replacement. Giovani Lo Celso is also attracting interest from Barcelona. West Ham - Alan Smith Do not expect a busy month. Last summer saw significant investment, with the midfield revamped following Declan Rice ’s departure to Arsenal, and manager David Moyes is always quick to caution how difficult it is to do good business in the winter. Top of their wishlist is a new centre forward but Moyes has repeatedly said since the start of the campaign there is no value for money around the striker market. Serhou Guirassy, the Bundesliga’s top scorer aside from Harry Kane, has been linked - along with at least a dozen other clubs. Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus, who will be heading to the Africa Cup of Nations next week, have been used up top in recent weeks and enjoyed plenty of success on the break. The Hammers are most likely persist with that approach until the summer before seeking to add a proven goalscorer then. Wolves - Neil Moxley Gary O’Neil has admitted for some time that he needs an out-and-out striker. The evidence is already pointing at the fact that the Molineux club will make a move in that area - the only mystery is the identity of that individual. Sasa Kalajdzic has only just returned following a lengthy lay-off with an injury to his knee and is reported to be interested in a move to Eintract Frankfurt. While Fabio Silva has already made the switch north to link up with Rangers on a loan deal. Hee-Chan Hwang is Wolves’ leading scorer but he will be leaving the Black Country shortly to join up with South Korea for the Asian Cup. All of that leaves O’Neil short in forward areas. The only other item of consideration is whether Wolves, who have had issues with financial fair play, will be able to make the deal permanent or whether the cash constraints will leave them eyeing a temporary move.

175578023,XL Bully campaigners win temporary injunction to stop 240 dogs in rescue homes being put down after...,"XL Bully campaigners have won a temporary injunction that will stop 240 dogs in rescue homes from being put down after strict new laws came into force on New Year's Eve. Under the Government's guidelines, XL Bully dogs that arrived in rescue homes since October 31, which had not been rehomed, would have to be killed because they don't qualify for an exemption to stay there. It was thought an estimated 240 dogs would be destroyed as a result until one rescue centre took an injunction to review the rules. Carla Lane Animals in Need, a 40-year-old care home in Liverpool, said rescue centres do not have to destroy the dogs from today as many had planned. A High Court Judge ordered: 'No XL Bully dog may be seized from a Rehoming Organisation... and/or destroyed for want of or ineligibility for a certification of exemption on grounds that the dog was taken into the RO's care after 31 October 2023 until the further Order of the Court.' In a statement, the 40-year-old Liverpudlian rescue centre said: 'The law has not been changed but we have been granted some further time for this specific issue to be considered fully by the Court, which means that dogs placed in rescues after 31 October are safe from destruction or seizure FOR NOW. 'There are various other serious and important matters to be heard by the Court in the near future, but for present purposes this ruling means that rescues now DO NOT AT THE MOMENT PENDING A FURTHER COURT DECISION have to destroy dogs who came into their care after 31 October 2023 on the grounds that it would not be possible for a rescue to apply for exemption of those dogs. 'We know that some rescues were sadly planning to do so today and whilst we do not yet have any detailed solution, we now have the benefit of some further time for the matter to be considered by the Court.' XL Bully campaigning group Don't Ban Me Licence Me said the ruling 'will strengthen' their legal challenge to the laws. They said: 'Carla Lane Animals In Need have been successful in securing an injunction for all rescue XL Bully 'type' dogs who were taken in after October 31 from being seized or destroyed. 'This is pending a full hearing in January. While this action is separate to our Judicial Review application, this positive outcome will strengthen our case.' Under new laws which came into effect yesterday, it is now illegal to breed, sell and rehome an XL Bully-type dog and they must be muzzled and kept on lead while in public. Some owners shared photographs of their animals in their new muzzles, though some say their pets are 'ripping them off' and refusing to wear them. However, others were still trying to rehome their animals yesterday, either appearing to think the law is not yet in effect or openly expressing their contempt for the legislation. It comes as some vets are refusing to put down XL Bully dogs despite new laws that will see a crackdown on the big powerful dogs. By the start of February it will become a criminal offence to own an XL Bully in England and Wales without a certificate of exemption. Dog lovers have been urged to apply for an exemption by the deadline of January 31 or face putting their beloved pets down - but multiple vets are refusing to euthanise the animals. ]The Government is offering Bully XL owners £200 compensation to owners who do not wish to signs up to its scheme to have the dog euthanised, but vets are saying they will not do this.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12916167/american-bully-xl-campaigners-injunction-stop-dogs-dying-rescue-homes.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/01/01/12/79502993-0-image-m-13_1704111310582.jpg,2024-01-01 14:03:50,"Dan Grennan, Editor","['Dan Grennan', 'Editor']",en,gb,-0.356
175595735,Funeral remembers the wonderful life of Councillor Noreen McGarvey,"Donegal today said goodbye to a woman who didn’t see problems but always saw solutions in life as Councillor Noreen McGarvey was laid to rest. St Columba’s Church in Burtonport was overflowing as Noreen’s family, friends and colleagues spent the first day of the New Year saying honouring the life of a woman who spent many of her years serving her community. Noreen, 52, passed away recently at the Donegal Hospice surrounded by her family after a brave battle with illness. Born in Kincasslagh in 1971, Noreen made a huge impact in the lives of all those she touched. Her funeral mass heard that from an early age she always went out of her way to make people laugh and she did that for many years to come. As a child her family recalled her having a t-shirt with the words ‘The devil made me do it’ which captured Noreen’s sense of fun so well. Noreen was involved in many facets of local life and was a member of Cruit Island Golf Club, the Burtonport Variety Group, Scor and the choir at St Columba’s Church. Fr Pat Ward told mourners that Noreen was first diagnosed with her illness seven years ago and had coped well with it until it returned two years ago. However, she thought her illness was more of a “nuisance” and she did not burden her family or friends with her illness, preferring to keep that between herself and her doctors while always carrying herself with great poise and dignity. “She didn’t want pity. She didn’t live that way. She didn’t want people that she could make laugh looking at her with sadness. She didn’t want them looking at her and feeling that pity for her. “That was just not going to be part of the end of Noreen McGarvey’s life. She wanted to continue to live, to laugh and to love and that’s what she did,” he said. When she knew her time on this earth was coming to an end, she hinted to her family and friends about how she wanted her funeral mass to go. Instead of plain white flowers on hr coffin, she requested bright flowers to include sunflowers to reflect the colour she always saw and brought to life. She also requested to be laid to rest in her Cruit Island Golf Club jacket which was a huge part of her life having served as Lady Captain for two terms. However, Fr Ward stressed that despite her requests, Noreen did not want any fuss. She was a huge Meatloaf fan and was so disappointed when the singer had the cheek to write a musical about his life before she could! He also recalled her alter ego of Viola, a larger than life character with oversize jumper and glasses whom Noreen brought to life on many occasions. As a councillor, Fr Pat said that Noreen was always there to help people. He said “Most of us would have known that she worked in Pat the Cope’s office in Dungloe and there she was an indispensable part of his team but also that anybody who went into that office to try and get something organised. “She wasn’t a person who seen problems, she was a person who saw solutions and she would just love to get stuck into whatever was brought her way and to find an answer and to move onto the next thing, happy that she had helped somebody along the way. “It seemed to be a natural step to her to actually become a member of the council. It was already in her life, she was community-minded, she worked for people, she liked people and she liked to make people happy. And so it was a small step for her to join Donegal County Council as a councillor and become part of that.” Among the many in the congregation were her family including her daughter Amy, parents Susie and Seamus, brother Declan, sisters Debbie and Colette and her wide circle of extended family and friends. Former MEP, Minister and TD, Pat the Cope Gallagher, for whom Noreen worked with for more than 20 years, was also present. The Government and Tanaiste Micheal Martin was represented by Commandant Claire Mortimer while many of Councillor McGarvey’s colleagues from the world of national and local politics and from Donegal County Council were also present. Fr Ward said the congregation could be still at the mass until midnight talking about Noreen McGarvey and all she had accomplished in her fifty two years, a life so full that many people who lived for ninety years multiplied by ten could not have filled. The final words were left to Noreen’s beloved daughter Amy. Amy thanked all her mother’s neighbours and friends for helping them to prepare them for her mother’s final days as well as the various medical teams and local clergy. She said that although she could never hope to emulate her mother, she decided to remember Noreen in poetry before delivering a heartbreaking, emotional, witty and searingly honest tribute which resulted in a huge spontaneous round of applause. Fr Ward responded by saying that he had no doubt that Noreen McGarvey would be around for many years to come. Members of Noreen’s family accompanied her coffin out of the church to the uplifting sounds of the hymn, Lord of the Dance. Amidst tears and sadness, there were smiles as the words of the song filled the church. “Dance, dance, wherever you may be…..” It’s what Noreen would have wanted. May she rest in peace.",https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/01/01/funeral-remembers-the-wonderful-life-of-councillor-noreen-mcgarvey/,https://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Noreen.jpg,2024-01-01 14:03:56,Staff Writer,['Staff Writer'],en,ie,0.13
